The flexibility of gold loans | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The flexibility of gold loans October 14, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share People borrow money from various kinds of financial lenders who provide mortgages for a diverse range of circumstances. This could be for supporting a venture or it may be for a more personal requirement, like schooling or a real estate property purchase. A gold loan demanding a gold loan interest rate is one of the most prominent of the several loan choices available for borrowers to select from, considering the various specifications and criteria they have to go through to acquire them. Gold jewellery is used as security by banks to loan you the money you want under the terms of secured gold loans and an interest rate of gold loans. Getting a gold loan at the lowest gold loan interest rate is a straightforward process. Based on the lender (banks and non-banking financial companies), you may be able to borrow up to 60 to 75 per cent of the gold's worth, considering the maximum loan-to-value ratio allowed by the Reserve Bank of India. Why gold loan is popular among people? Gold is a valuable resource that people are likely to put money into for guaranteed high returns, despite the market crash of any other commodity or industry. For a variety of reasons, including the fact that they may be used for different purposes and can be obtained without a specific justification, gold loans are becoming more and more popular among people nowadays. Banks and NBFCs are ready to offer money to the borrowers against their gold ornaments since the valuables in this case are committed to the lenders. Most individuals are aware of the benefits of gold loans, including their affordability, convenience, and speed. People might not always be aware of the many additional benefits that gold loans offer along with affordable gold loan interest rates, which makes them the ideal solution for their financial requirements. How flexible are gold loans? The whole gold loan acquisition procedure is very comparable to other secured loans, however, it is far more simple compared to others. In this scenario, you deliver your gold items and the necessary paperwork to a lender to get a gold loan at an interest rate of gold loans. The lender assesses the quality and the weight of gold items and examines the provided paperwork. The lender approves the loan amount based on the evaluations. It is an easy process since the gold is taken as the security in the deal of a gold loan. According to the terms of the loan, you return the gold items that were pledged after paying off the principal and the interest rate of gold loans. Benefits of getting a gold loan compared to other loans Gold loans are secured loans compared to other forms of personal loans, meaning the customer must provide the bank or NBFC with a precious commodity as security. While unsecured loans are not guaranteed by any kind of security, lenders run a larger chance of going bankrupt. In the case of a gold loan, if the borrower fails to repay the loan and the interest rate of gold loans, the lender can take the commodity for auction and get the value they get. This guarantee enables the lender to confidently extend a loan to the borrower. Due to this guarantee for the creditor, consumers could be confident that their application will be accepted right away. The easiest and quickest method to get cash right now is to take out a gold loan with the lowest gold loan interest rate. This benefit of a gold loan may be quite helpful in any financial exigency, for instance, a healthcare or business problem. Even while certain other loan kinds can also be disbursed fast, the procedure might take a little time. After the documentation and processing period, gold will be disbursed immediately. In many instances, a gold loan increases grant affordability. Flexible payback not only enables budget planning but also helps the lender with less risk in a gold loan deal. Compared to other loan options, the interest rate of gold loans is the lowest, which helps with loan payback more quickly. How much is the maximum and minimum amount that you can get in a gold loan? Banks and non-banking financial companies provide a loan amount by demanding repayment of the loan with the interest rate of gold loans after considering the quality and quantity of the gold you provide. However, the amount you get will not go above the loan-to-value ratio and the maximum a lender could offer according to their gold loan policies. This leads to the fact that the amount you get for a gold loan and the gold loan interest rate are obviously dependent on the amount of gold you have to offer as security. If we take a look at some of the numbers in the market, some of the prominent lenders including Manappuram Finance offer you loan amounts from 10,000 up to 1 crore and more regarding the borrower and the gold they commit in a gold loan. Everyone who has gold with them is eligible for a gold loan Besides, borrowers of gold loans can use the amount for anything without any legal issues. For your flamboyant wedding, to fuel your business ideas, during health emergencies, or anything that you need some extra cash in hand for could be satisfied with a gold loan from a reputed lender like Manappuram Finance. One thing that a borrower should keep up with is the timely repayment of the principal amount of the gold loan alongside the interest rate of gold loans. Failed or late repayments will result in late payment charges and penalties alongside an increase in the gold loan interest rate. How to avoid penalties and an increase in the gold loan interest rate? Acquiring an amount that is enough to satisfy your financial needs is the first step to an affordable repayment of any gold loan arrangement. Borrowers should not overlook the aftereffects that happen with the gold loan interest rate from the first step of the application process in a gold loan arrangement. The interest rate of gold loans becomes big along with the amount you get from the lender. So, it is imperative to keep the loan amount you get under your budget capability. Moreover, the timeline of the gold loan you select is better when it is short so that you can repay the whole amount and the gold loan interest rate quick as possible. The total amount you have to pay as the interest rate of gold loans will be lesser if the loan tenure is short since you will be paying a lesser amount of fixed interest rate as a monthly payment.

Nevertheless, there are various other lending options accessible, and it could be challenging for you to decide which one. Here, it is one reason for you to go with an affordable gold loan rate per gram of the gold you own as collateral. Whether an urgent financial need for business or a temporary need for credit for pressing circumstances including vehicle loans, student loans, and more, there are an infinite number of options to get money. And acquiring money with your gold for the interest of gold loans is among the best options in them.Why a gold loan is inexpensive?A gold loan is said to be inexpensive compared to other kinds of loan options for a financial emergency. It saves a borrower money and time by making the loan approval procedures a lot faster and letting them borrow money at the lowest interest rate of gold loans from prominent lenders like Manappuram Finance. Some say that a gold loan can save you money by getting money for your gold asset as security while also reducing the number of times you have to travel between a lender and your home for documentation procedures and approval. And it is true with all the different options available for taking and paying back a gold loan rate per gram amount of your gold. People in financial need will profit from obtaining a gold loan rate per gram of their gold since they can acquire a larger sum at a reduced interest of gold loans. Numerous independent gold lending companies don't need you to present any income documentation. Nevertheless, banks working in this sector can require certain documentation evidence to confirm your creditworthiness. A look at the different options and advantages a gold loan offers.All the professionals who know the economy and financial management support borrowing money for the lowest interest of gold loans. Alternative options, including credit cards and unsecured loans like personal loans, have high charges and may subsequently cause financial stress for consumers who are already stretched thin with different financial obligations. Gold loan rate per gram of your gold is widely available and easily obtainable and, in comparison, less costly. All within an hour, you could essentially enter with gold and go home with cash. Or, the amount will be credited to your bank account within a few hours to make it convenient. Besides, to be qualified for a gold loan, you are not required to have a credit record. There is no processing fee for a gold loanNearly every other type of financial lending, such as EMIs and personal loans, has a processing charge. The processing costs, however, are the main advantage of a gold loan rate per gram of your gold. Manappuram Finance, one of the largest gold loan companies, does not impose processing fees to provide a gold loan for borrowers. You only need to deposit gold in order to receive a loan with a reasonable interest of gold loans. Everything including document submission, signing, collateral exchange, etc. takes very less time to process, yet there is no processing for a gold loan makes it unparallel compared to other lending options. The lowest interest of gold loans. When compared to the interest rates of various lending options, the interest of gold loans in the economy stands at approximately 12–15% annually. This results in an astounding difference in the baseline interest rates of personal loans and gold loans, which puts getting a gold loan rate per gram of gold on the top shelf for financial experts as well as for many borrowers. No prepayment charges for gold loans from NBFCsBorrowers with personal loans instead of a gold loan rate per gram of gold they own found it challenging to complete the repayment fast even if they can afford it. It is sometimes due to prepayment fees imposed by some banks over the loan principal amount and the interest rate. However, consumers won't have to pay many of these additional fees if they take out a gold loan from NBFCs. This allows borrowers to take back their priceless gold quickly and conclude the loan arrangement without spending more. No EMI / interest-only option to repay the loan Among the benefits that are exclusive to Gold loans is this one. Being the financial lender, NBFCs are able to provide you with an interest-only option because they have gold as a guarantee, and its value exceeds the sum of the actual value of your loan. Being the borrower, you do not have to make a fixed monthly instalment that combines principal repayment and interest payments. This option lets the lender keep the loan account active since the borrower is paying the interest of gold loans without fail. And the account will be closed when the borrower takes back the gold by completing the repayment along with the principal loan amount and interest of gold loans. This is a flexibility that most people desire to have while running on a tight budget. How to get the most value in a gold loan with the lowest interest of gold loans The optimum gold loan rate per gram of gold or the appropriate interest of gold loans should be taken into account when applying for a gold loan under a financial need. Jewellery made of gold has a value that let you get a gold loan at a lower interest of gold loan than other types of loans that are not secured with any commodity. The interest of gold loans does, however, differ between lenders that including banks and NBFCs. In addition, there are a few additional significant variables that affect the total gold loan rate per gram of gold you get along with the interest of gold loans. Several gold loan providers could provide customers with a higher or lower interest of gold loans depending on the value of your offered collateral - which is your gold in a gold loan. Let's take a look at some factors you have to consider to get a lower interest on gold loans while applying for a gold loan. Choose a reputed bank or NBFC Several jewellers and small lenders are available in the financial field to provide you with a gold loan rate per gram of your gold. However, it is mostly advised to choose a bank or a Non-Banking Financial Company since they are more secure. Gold loans are offered by both banks and NBFCs with lower interest for gold loans, but it's crucial to compare interest rates, eligibility requirements, and the total loan amount of each. This is to avoid any kind of hidden charges when you are already too far from going back into a gold loan agreement with any of the lenders. It is crucial for consumers to conduct thorough research on all of the lenders they are thinking about applying for a loan from. Never get excited and pick your choices without enough research while taking a gold loan due to the pressure of your financial emergency. Choose a lender who provides enough money regarding the quality of the goldThe worth of the gold has a significant impact on the gold loan rate per gram you get. The gold loan rate per gram will increase as the quality of the gold increases with purity. In order to qualify for a loan that has lower interest for gold loans from any of the lenders you choose, the gold committed should be between 18 and 24 carats in weight. If you wish to obtain a gold loan rate per gram against gold jewellery containing gemstones, the value of those stones will be subtracted. Only the genuine gold parts in a gold ornament will be evaluated for financing. All of these point to the reality that you should start out being cautious when you acquire a gold ornament. When choosing gold jewellery, always pick high-quality ones and those which actually get you enough from a loan with a lower interest for gold loans under a financial need. Look for the best and most affordable interest rate available from the lenders The interest of gold loans might fluctuate from 7 to 25 per cent per year because it is determined by the financial lender's risk analysis and updated policies. The interest rate on gold loans is determined by the LTV ratio, mortgage duration, total gold loan rate per gram a borrower gets, and certain other factors. For gold loan agreements, borrowers should always pick the lowest rate in interest of gold loan possible to avoid being hit by unforeseen financial difficulties. Choose the most affordable interest rate considering the tenure A Gold loan rate per gram for your gold is a loan that has short timelines with flexible repayment options and periods spanning between 7 days to three years. Borrowers should select the most reputable financial lender from among all the banks and NBFCs that offer a gold loan rate per gram at the lowest interest for gold loans on the market. When picking the duration, one must make sure that they are certain about their ability to repay the loan within this time frame. Higher interest rates are required when the duration is longer. So, it is advised to choose a loan scheme with a loan tenure longer than the time you require to repay the complete loan amount. Many borrowers make the error of selecting a longer term for a gold loan rate per gram scheme in the mistaken belief that they would have more time to repay the loan without urgency. However, if you take out a gold loan for a longer length of time, the interest of the gold loan arrangement you opt for will be higher, and you can wind up paying much more than you should if you can afford to pay back the loan quicker. Make the gold loan repayment effortlessPeriodic EMI, Interest first and principal later arrangements, partial payments, bullet payments, and more are available in the case of gold loan repayment. Choosing any of it is firmly based on the borrowers' ability to repay it without interrupting their financial flow. Let's look at a few things you should be careful about while taking or repaying a gold loan to make the repayment more manageable. Never go beyond what you actually need It is indeed crucial to make certain one asks for the precise gold loan rate per gram amount needed. Not getting enough or going beyond what you need during a financial emergency may make it difficult in the long run as the repayment of interest of gold loans. As the borrower, you will be obliged to pay more interest for every extra penny you get in a gold loan deal.To avoid paying larger interest fees, people who are planning to get a gold loan should estimate the maximum amount they need and stay within that limit. Smaller the loan amount, the smaller the interest you have to pay in a gold loan rate per gram of your gold. Regardless of when you're qualified for a large line of credit against your gold, adhering to the rules is crucial. Make the gold loan repayments your first-priority Borrowers of a gold loan rate per gram scheme must search for a provider giving the maximum gold loan rate per gram at a reasonable interest of gold loans once the anticipated loan amount required is established. Before choosing a lender, it is crucial to carry out a deep market investigation since the relevant interest rate has a significant effect on the monthly repayment due. While taking care of all your financial needs, you should always consider the repayment of a gold loan at the top of the list with high priority. Keeping the repayment of a fixed amount or the interest of gold loans for a little later will result in unexpected financial tightness for you. And this will eventually put you in a position in which you have to pay fines for late payments. Choose the shortest loan tenureAs aforementioned, the gold loan tenure has a direct impact on the interest of gold loans you have to pay. Always choose the shortest gold loan tenure while taking a gold loan rate per gram from any of the lenders available in the industry. Never let the gold loan deal spread across more time than you actually need to repay the whole amount and close the deal. You will be paying more when you opt for a longer tenure. Go for the perfect repayment optionsCustomers of a gold loan rate per gram arrangement have a variety of repayment choices at their disposal, including standard EMIs, bullet payments, and partial payouts. In the event of a bullet loan, the loan repayment is regarded as monthly; nonetheless, the whole loan balance must be repaid at maturity. The loan reaches maturity when it reaches the closure date in which you should take back the gold provided as a commodity while completing all financial obligations with the lender.This is a choice if the borrower anticipates improved financial circumstances at the time of repayment. The best alternative for repaying a gold loan rate per gram alongside the interest of gold loans is up to the individual. The registration fees, processing fees, and other expenses including any extra charges should also be considered. Nowadays, getting a gold loan for the interest of gold loans is a lot less complicated than it used to be. In recent times, several banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies have begun offering doorstep distribution of gold loans per gramme rate arrangements, in which the lender inspects and value and purity of the gold at the borrower's home before disbursing the loan within a few hours. This made it easier for many people to get a gold loan without physically visiting any of the branches of the financial lender. And the online services available across the lenders' websites and applications made all the extra support and services quick and effortless. Get emergency cash at the affordable interest of gold loansGetting a gold loan is far easier now than it was a few years back.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The most important steps in choosing the best gold loan provider November 03, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share Over the centuries, there has been a big growth in the gold loan industry, leading to the birth of many non-banking financial companies providing loans with affordable gold loan interest rates in India. As a result, there are plenty of alternatives for borrowers to choose the best mortgage plan with a lower interest rate of gold loans and a timeline to repay the principal amount along with the interest of gold loans. Since different banks and financial firms have different services, your decision in choosing a reputed lender and the most affordable scheme may have an influence on the value and every other aspect of your gold loan. For instance, different lenders impose different gold loan interest rates since they determine their own interest rates after considering the loan arrangement and the current market value of the gold. How much money can a borrower get in a gold loan? Security measures and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio might also vary according to the kind of borrower you are and the creditworthiness among various financial organisations. Both these are equally significant when it comes to acquiring enough emergency funds for any kind of financial emergency. Your loan amount will depend on your Loan-to-Value ratio and other factors including the gold loan interest rate, gold loan tenure, the market value of gold, etc., and the security measures a firm provides will guarantee the protection of your jewellery. Due to such variations, gold loan consumers often decide to switch gold loan providers in order to take advantage of lower fees, lower gold loan interest rates, bigger LTVs, and improved security for their precious gold valuables. You can choose which is the ideal gold loan company for you by conducting in-depth research on all the available businesses. Manappuram Finance is one of the major gold loan providers in the country with the most affordable interest rate of gold loans available for everyone irrespective of their financial background and credit history. Let's take alook at some of the major facts about gold loan arrangements, gold loan interest rates, and more. How to choose a gold loan lender? There are a couple of important things to think of while choosing the right financial organisation for your loan transmission or gold loan application with acceptable gold valuables. By doing enough research and considering every factor that will affect the loan value and the loan repayment along with the interest rate of gold loans, a borrower can make absolutely sure that they get the greatest gold loan possible at the lowest gold loan interest rate. Along with LTV, gold loan interest rate, and insurance, you must also take the various repayment options into account. If the gold loan timeline offered by your lender is too long for your economic state and monthly budget expenses, it may be challenging to repay the debt including the principal loan amount and the interest rate of gold loans. Because of this, it's critical to prepare in advance and pick a reputed and reliable financial lender and the best loan arrangement that provides affordable and flexible gold loan repayment choices. By doing this, monthly delays of financial obligations alongside the gold loan interest rate could well be avoided. To assist customers in the timely settlement of the entire gold loan balance and the interest rate of gold loans, leading gold loan businesses like Manappuram Finance extend loan terms further than the industry norm of 12 months and more. Tips to choose the best gold loan lender for your financial emergencies Loans against gold valuables are an excellent option for the majority of mortgage consumers since they are secured with gold collateral and offer reduced repayment charges including gold loan interest rates. Nevertheless, to guarantee a trouble-free registration and payback procedure, customers must verify the finest gold loan providers in the market like Manappuram Finance which provides specific advantages to the borrowers. Whenever choosing the finest gold loan firm with an affordable interest rate of gold loan, keep the following lending elements in mind to guarantee effortless loan exchanges and disbursements. Customized gold loan arrangement and experience You can't find a readymade alternative for services related to financial needs because the monetary demands of people may vary regarding their economic circumstances. This is why proper research about the financial lender and the arrangements they offer is important while taking a gold loan. The organisational structure of the gold loan lending firm of your choice must be flexible enough to fit your needs. As a consumer, you should ideally take advantage of any services that the financing firm provides that are useful to you or whoever or whatever you are taking the gold loan for. As an example, many consumers would like to be reminded when it's time to make the repayment of the loan amount and the gold loan interest rates. Fast processing of gold loan services and customer service One must select a gold loan provider with a quick response time and simple documentation procedure when submitting an application for gold loans while looking out for the best interest rate of gold loans. Anyone could fulfil an immediate financial requirement if they have immediate access to finances. And a well-reputed gold loan lender can only help you with fast and secure gold loan arrangements. To swiftly issue a mortgage that is secured upon the gold collateral, a financial lender's gold loan management and monitoring system should be innovative with a spotless process and involvement of technology throughout the whole procedure. Information and service access from wherever you are While working in and managing finance and personally identifiable data and information, effective control is essential especially in the case of a financial company since they will be managing the information and gold collaterals of many individuals altogether. Consequently, the gold loan issuer's loan management system must include a centralized database that allows immediate access to their details and fund from anywhere for consumers. In this manner, a clear overview of a borrower's profile is visible to the whole lending business team so that they can help the consumer from anywhere at any time. Gold loan officers can pull consumer data from centralised databases, including CIBIL scores, repayment histories, personal details, KYC data, and more. This procedure guarantees the accuracy of the consumer's details and the financial documents across every outlet online and offline. They only need to log in to borrowers' online accounts to make on-time instalments. Availability of online and offline portals for services To enable the gold loan application, disbursal, and repaying procedures are as user-friendly as possible through a financial organization, a customer interface that is straight forward, transparent, and simple to comprehend and work with is essential. As a gold loan borrower who is obliged to repay the loan and the gold loan interest rates, to make the financing process simpler, financial lenders should provide mobile-based and web-based applications and gold loan service portals. For optimal clarity, these kinds of software services should include comprehensive loan information that allows users to access their accounts and track the status of their loans. Protection for the collateral and protection from fraudulent activities It is imperative to go with a financial lender that provides complete protection for your physical gold valuables until you take it back after repaying the principal loan amount and the gold loan interest rate.

Read further to know more about the amount of gold loan you can get and how the interest for gold loans is imposed.The amount of gold you should possess to get a gold loanAnyone who has any amount of gold can get a gold loan at a specified interest for gold loans regarding the schemes they choose. Different financial lenders provide distinct arrangements for gold loans that mostly include a minimum range and maximum range to get a loan for gold.So, you have to find the perfect firm that offers you the best service and loan amount for your gold while taking a gold loan. Manappuram Finance offers the lowest gold loan interest rate for you without many obligations like other loan services.Gold loan rate and the interest for gold loanEvery loan's effective interest rate imposed on the borrower has a significant impact on how much must be repaid. The financial institutions including banks and NBFCs consider a number of elements when determining the interest rate for gold loans before approving an application for a gold loan.After getting a loan for your gold, you must return the principal as well as the interest charged on the loan throughout repayment. Financiers may provide loans at distinct gold loan per gram rates. Besides, it's also possible that two individuals getting a gold loan from the same lender may get different terms to repay the gold loan amount.How the interest for gold loans are calculated?If you are confused about the interest you have to pay for gold loans, you should realize that they are a lot less compared to the interest you have to pay for Personal Loans. Manappuram Finance bases its lowest gold loan interest rate on the current state of gold across the market.The amount of gold loan you may obtain upon your gold may change depending on different schemes based on the purity of gold, the current price of gold, and the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio. It depends on how much gold you chose to commit altogether.Factors that play a part in the interest for gold loansThere are several things that influence the amount of gold loan and its interest rate. Let's take a look at some of the major factors that could directly impact these rates.●Loan AmountThe loan amount is the quantity of cash you agree to pay the lender over a specific time frame in exchange for the gold bond. The loan amount is often considered to be 75% of the value of the security you offer in the form of gold and is typically approved by lenders. Now you know that the total amount of gold you committed determines the loan amount you get from the lender.The amount of gold loan will increase along with the amount of gold you pledge. However, remember that the interest for gold loans will also increase alongside the amount of the gold loan. Moreover, it also depends on the value of gold at the time pledged by the borrower.●Monthly income or the repayment capacity of the borrowerThe interest for gold loans will be imposed on the gold loan an individual borrows from a lender after considering the repayment capacity of the borrower. Several financiers might not require it because the gold loan is secured by collateral, but some could in order to determine your creditworthiness for the loan ask for a few documents that prove you are eligible.The ability to pay the loan back will also be greater if the monthly revenue is sufficient, which will enable anyone to qualify for a gold loan at the lowest gold loan interest rate. An applicant for a gold loan does not have any trouble obtaining the loan approved by a bank or any financial organisation in contrast to other kinds of loans.However, the chances of your ability to repay the principal amount along with the interest rate will increase if you have sufficient revenue through a constant monthly income. You can obtain a loan with the lowest gold loan interest rates if your monthly earnings are bigger.●Different benchmarks regarding the lenderMCLR and repo rate related lending rates are two of the principal benchmarks used by banks when offering loans against gold. Depending on the benchmark each lender uses, gold loan interest rates tend to fluctuate from one lender to the next.The term "MCLR" (marginal cost of funds-based lending rate) refers to the lowest interest rate below which financial firms are not able to make loans, with some exceptions. Since MCLR is an internal benchmark, the lender determines the rate independently based on the timeline of a loan that has to be repaid.●The credit score of the applicantOne important factor that some of the banks and NBFCs consider when determining the interest for gold loans that you have to pay is the credit score. An excellent credit score shows that an applicant has an excellent repayment history across different loans he already took and is creditworthy.The credit score is not an important factor in a gold loan since it is solely based on the gold, however, some lenders need it to confirm your eligibility for the loan.●External factors like inflation and gold price in the global marketSince gold is a price-dominated product, its price rises along with inflation. Specialists claim that this has been the fact since lenders often provide up to 75% of the whole worth of the gold that is guaranteed in a gold loan. In the event that the gold price begins to decrease in worth, this figure may increase up to 85%.Lenders, such as banks or other financial institutions like NBFCs, determine a standard gold valuation for customers by tracking changes in prices of gold over a timeline or by examining the current fluctuations happening in the average price of gold. Along with it, the grade and fineness of the gold getting committed are then looked at in order to assess a loan for the consumer alongside a rate of interest for gold loans.●Demand and supply of goldGold was and is in great demand all across India. In India, the yellow metal is a sign of riches which is used in presents, jewellery, and more. The wedding season sees a significant increase in cost. Additionally, tiny amounts of gold are utilised in the production of electrical components and are also used in the medical field.Being a relatively safe and popular investment choice that may be utilised to protect against inflation, It serves as security for loans, and gold loans are among the most popular lending market. Moreover, a gold loan is quickly approved, as well as the procedure of application is straightforward and is available at the lowest gold loan interest rate.The amount of the gold loan and the interest rate are directly impacted by an increase in the price of gold.How to choose a lender with the lowest gold loan interest rate?Given that a borrower could obtain immediate money by using their ornaments as security, gold loans are a common choice within the secured loan sector. It enables individuals to utilise their gold jewellery, that would have otherwise been stashed away in some kind of a vault and left unused.Banks and NBFCs offer different schemes to obtain loans for gold that are repayable along with an interest for gold loan. Manappuram Finance offers the best gold loan arrangements with the lowest gold loan interest rate.●Compare the different interest rates across different lendersGovernment-based and independent money lenders that give loans against a range of collateral are abundant in India's financial industry. Additionally, each service they provide has its conditions. One with loans secured by gold is the disparity in interest for gold loans charged by various banks and NBFCs.Some of them like Manappuram Finance offer a great deal with the lowest gold loan interest rate regarding the scheme and gold loan amount. To choose an appropriate deal, you must evaluate the interest for gold loans being offered by a few reputable banks and NBFCs.Online calculators for interest rates to find the lowest gold loan interest rate are widely available and cost nothing. Anyone could use many of the online calculators to find out about the gold loan interest rates that are provided by several lenders.●Stay updated with the terms and regulationsDue to the shifting financial climate and variations in the market value of various collaterals, terms and conditions for any type of loan issued by lenders never remain constant. To receive the greatest price for their gold, anyone interested in securing a loan against it should also keep up with these trends.Due to missed monthly interest payments, or other factors, banks and other financial lenders may raise their interest rates after a fixed timeline. You can wind up spending more money on interest as a result of this recent increase. Therefore, you must carefully read the terms and conditions to prevent these occurrences.●Find the total loan amount instead of just the interest for gold loansWhen comparing the interest rate and the loan amount supplied by various lenders, there is a good risk that a borrower will get completely bewildered by the low-interest rates they offer. While some could offer the lowest gold loan interest rate, their loan amounts offered might not be sufficient for your needs.Therefore, resist being seduced by the lender's tempting interest rates.

War in Ukraine: Impact on Global & Indian Economy | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. War in Ukraine: Impact on Global & Indian Economy April 12, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share On 24 February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that has been simmering since 2014. Denounced by the US and its allies as a war of aggression, it is the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War II. Russia's economy is only the world's 11th largest with a GDP of about $1.5 trillion but its vast oil and gas resources and its status as a leading producer and exporter of metals and other commodities makes it an important player in world trade. As Western sanctions on Russia tightened in response to its invasion of Ukraine, it disrupted the country’s oil sales. Crude prices surged to over $139 a barrel in March 2022, the highest levels since 2008, aggravating global inflation already running hot after the pandemic-induced disruptions to the global supply chain. In Europe, the price of wholesale natural gas spiked to new highs which will further exacerbate inflation and slow down growth to give rise to fears of stagflation. It also makes the task of global central banks trying to cool inflation a lot more difficult. The crisis is also putting more stress on the already stretched global supply chains. And should the war continue for much longer, things could get a lot worse.The sanctions imposed on RussiaRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has drawn a harsh response from the US, the UK, the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and some other countries. Severe sanctions have been imposed by the western powers on Russian companies, banks, oil and gas sector etc., that have drastically altered the rules of the game for the global economy. The effect has been to isolate Russia from global financial and trade networks, thereby bringing about a collapse in the value of its currency and financial assets, and sending energy, metals and food prices soaring.Further, it has led to an exodus of leading international companies from Russia. From the tech giants to automobile manufacturers, retailers and airlines have all suspended their activities in Russia. Container shipping lines have cut down their services. Visa and Mastercard have decided to walk out of Russia and their cards don’t work anymore in the country, leaving millions unable to make payments using these cards. Boeing and Airbus will no longer service Russian airlines. The exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT payment system, the freeze on Russian assets, and denial of new funding is likely to affect about 70-80% of Russia’s banking system. The sanctions have cut off Russia's two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB, from the market for US dollars. Seven Russian banks (including VTB) have been removed from SWIFT, a global messaging service that connects financial institutions and facilitates rapid and secure payments. The Western powers are trying to prevent Russia's central bank from selling dollars and other foreign currencies to defend its currency (the ruble) and its economy. In total, nearly $1 trillion worth of Russian assets have now been frozen by sanctions. However, while the war and its backlash inflict havoc on Russia, the repercussions are also being felt around the world. Even before the invasion, the global economy was faced with multiple stress factors such as surging inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, volatile stock and bond prices etc.Impact on the global financial systemThe potential impact of the sanctions on the world outside Russia has apparently not been fully acknowledged. The fact is that the economic consequences will go well beyond the price we pay at the petrol pump. Back in the days of the global financial crisis of 2008, most risks were contained within the banking sector. However, while the banks look to be in good shape today, more shadowy risks have emerged elsewhere, that put at risk even the closely regulated parts of the financial system. We are at a stage where the world is awash with the free money let loose by central banks to keep their economies afloat after the 2008 collapse. Consequently, given how asset prices have inflated into the bubble territory, and how debt levels have risen to new highs, we may be more vulnerable than we think we are. The global economy is now more inter-connected, and harsh sanctions that keep out Russia from the international economy can have unexpected consequences leading to a slowdown in growth and higher inflation.The impact will be felt through three channels. Firstly, as prices for commodities like food and energy increase, inflation levels that are already high will go up even further. As income gets eroded by inflation, demand will fall. Secondly, European countries, especially those bordering Russia and Ukraine, will have to deal with a host of issues and challenges arising from disrupted trade, supply chains, and remittances, as well as a surge in refugee inflows. Thirdly, the blow to business confidence and the heightened uncertainty for investors classes will weigh on the equity markets giving rise to a risk-off sentiment which can potentially lead to outflows of capital from emerging markets.Oil importing countries will experience higher fiscal and trade deficits that contribute to inflation. With food and fuel prices going further up, it may spur unrest in third world countries from Africa to Latin America to Asia and beyond. Ukraine and Russia together account for about 29% of all wheat exports. Wheat futures have spiked, making the commodity more expensive for producers of food products who will now be forced to pass on the costs to consumers. For India, the unwelcome news is that palm oil prices have also gone up as markets scramble to find alternatives to sunflower oil for which Ukraine has been the major supplier.European governments are likely to face additional fiscal pressures from having to spend more on energy security and on upgrading their military and defence forces in light of the new security challenges. Eastern Europe is likely to see rising financing costs and a surge in refugees having absorbed most of the 3 million people who recently fled Ukraine. The sharp increase in costs for essential commodities will make it harder for policymakers around the world to strike a balance between containing inflation and supporting the economic recovery after the pandemic shocks.Source: IMFRisk to the petrodollarFurther, it is not inconceivable that the US led sanctions on Russia may bring forward the decline of the petrodollar system in place since 1973 and which has propped up the US dollar’s status as a reserve currency. The petrodollar system is an arrangement under which oil producers sell their output to the US and the rest of the world for dollars. Thereafter, these countries recycle the proceeds back into dollar-denominated assets parked in the US, especially US treasury and corporate debt. So far, this arrangement has supported the USD as the world’s reserve currency by creating an artificial demand for dollar and contributed to the US position as the world’s leading financial power. However, now there are credible reports that leading oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia are in active talks with Beijing to price some of its oil sales to China in yuan. If this move bears fruit, it can undermine the petrodollar’s dominance of the global petroleum market and, in turn, the entire global financial system that runs on dollars. Bear in mind that in recent years the US has relentlessly taken advantage of the dollar’s reserve status by printing as much currency as needed to fund their high deficits, effectively a debasement of the currency. China buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports and if this were to get priced in yuan, it will boost the Chinese currency’s international standing and put it on a path to becoming a global petroyuan reserve currency to rival the US dollar.Impact on the US Fed’s inflation fightThe US Federal Reserve raised interest rates on March 16 by a quarter percentage point and signalled its intention to hike rates at all the six meetings remaining in this year. “The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity,” a statement released by the Fed’s rate setting committee said. The Fed faces the difficult task of combating high inflation while ensuring that growth does not suffer. If the Fed were to go too slow with the tightening, it runs the risk of allowing inflation to get out of hand, which would necessitate even more painful action down the line. Tighten too aggressively, and it risks displeasing the markets and tipping the economy into a recession. The Ukraine war has sent the cost of fuel, food, and metals higher, raising fears of 1970s-style stagflation with heightened risks to prices, growth, and financial-market stability. While the war need not deter the Fed from sticking to its goal of taming inflation, it does reduce the visibility on the likely outcomes of its policy actions. In other words, it diminishes its ability to make accurate forecasts as the margin of error increases.Consumer price inflation stood at a four-decade hight of 7.9% in February compared to a year ago. The Fed is now convinced that it must make borrowing more expensive to squeeze out high inflation before it gets entrenched in the consumer psyche. The war in Ukraine fuels inflation with higher energy and grain prices as also higher prices for commodities including metals. It elevates the risk of a sharper economic slowdown than what the Fed would have bargained for. The prospect of a recession is likely to cool down the Fed’s appetite to push up rates quickly. The war also complicates the Fed's stance on reducing its $8.7 trillion balance sheet which would have the effect of sucking liquidity out of the financial system. Ideally, it would prefer to announce a plan with adequate advance notice to the markets but if the war were to cause major revisions in the outlook for growth, the Fed would be forced to act in real-time thereby setting off jitters in the market.rnImpact on India’s economyLast week IMF warned that the global economic fallout of the war in Ukraine is expected to negatively impact India's economy through several channels which would differ from those that affected us during COVID-19. The sharp rise in global oil prices represents a significant trade shock with macro-economic implications. It will lead to higher inflation and higher current account deficit. India's macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong, but the unfolding global developments pose additional risks from the spillover, RBI noted in its recent monthly bulletin. The spiralling oil and gas prices and unsettled financial market conditions also pose fresh headwinds to the still incomplete global recovery, it observed.rnThe expected hike in crude oil will increase petrol and diesel prices resulting in higher overall inflation as manufacturing and transportation costs become expensive. As Russia was the leading global exporter of fertilisers, the sanctions have led to a spike in fertiliser prices. The price of urea (the most widely used fertiliser in India) and diammonium phosphate (second most widely used) have more than doubled from a year ago, according to Bloomberg data for India. Fertiliser prices had seen a steep rise in 2021 because of the increase in gas prices (natural gas is a feedstock for fertilizer production), strong US demand, and supply constraints. The current disturbances have provided an additional fillip to prices. In India’s case, much of this burden is borne by the government which absorbs the increase via higher subsidies to protect the agriculture sector.Analysts conclude that the impact on India’s economy will be felt mostly through higher cost-push inflation weighing on all economic agents—households, businesses, and government. According to Nomura, every 10% rise in crude oil prices leads to a 0.4 percentage point-rise in consumer inflation. It increases import bills and widens India’s current account deficit (CAD). India’s CAD is expected to go up to 2.6% of the GDP in FY 2023, up from 1.7% estimated for FY 2022. This is likely to depreciate the rupee which recently plunged to a record low of 76.98 to a dollar. Consequently, there are good reasons to believe that India’s GDP growth will likely be lower while inflation runs hotter than the RBI’s estimates. That, in turn, points to the likelihood of a contraction in corporate earnings.rnThe Economic Survey 2022 estimated India’s GDP growth rate at 8.0 to 8.5 per cent in FY 2022-23, which assumes crude oil prices in a range of US$70-$75 a barrel. Today, with crude oil trading at prices well above US$100 per barrel, many sectors of the economy will be negatively impacted. The rising import bill will put pressure on the Indian Rupee and make imports more expensive adding to inflation. According to estimates provided by Economic Survey, an increase in global crude price by US$10 lowers GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point. Therefore, India’s GDP growth estimates for FY 2022-23 are due for some downward revisions.Some opportunities tooIndia’s wheat exporters are looking at unexpected gains from the Russia-Ukraine war as prices have skyrocketed amid sharply reduced supplies. As India may have an exportable surplus of 11-12 million tonne of wheat after meeting domestic requirements, we can look at close to US$5 billion worth of wheat exports in FY 2022-23. Given our bumper harvests and overflowing stock levels, farmers would benefit from the higher shipments as much as traders. The crisis is helping Indian farmers to skip government procurement at minimum support prices (MSP) and go with the higher rates offered by private players. More private interest and less government purchase is beneficial for the Centre because it otherwise provides compensation (subsidy) to the states for the economic cost of procurement. This is also a better deal for farmers who otherwise would have to sell their produce at MSP.Western sanctions on Russia have prompted many countries and companies to boycott its oil and gas. This has forced Russia to sell crude oil at deep discounts to ruling international prices. To capture this windfall, Indian refiners are floating tenders to buy discounted oil from Russia. For example, the Indian Oil Corporation recently bought three million barrels of Russian crude for May delivery at a discount of USD 20-25 a barrel. With imports making up for 85 per cent of India’s oil needs, it is now looking to contain spiralling energy bills through such purchases. Given India's relatively neutral stance on the war, Moscow's offer of oil and other commodities at discounted prices will provide relief on the fiscal front. Also, with the European Union being the biggest market for India’s exports, the supply disruptions to the EU are likely to generate greater demand for steel, engineering goods etc., for which India is an alternate supplier.In conclusion, it may be noted that should the war drag on, the consequences for the global economy will be quite severe with high inflation and slowing growth giving rise to stagflation. It is therefore to the advantage of all concerned that a ceasefire is promptly declared, and talks begin in earnest to arrive at a compromise that would take care of the essential interests of all sides in the conflict. The sooner peace is restored, the better it will be for the world, especially the third world countries whose people stand to suffer the most from higher food and energy prices.

Manappuram's Msme and Other Verticals’ Loans | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Manappuram's Msme and Other Verticals’ Loans March 24, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share MANAPPURAM'S MSME AND OTHER VERTICALS’ LOANSA business of Rs.800 crore built from scratch in 3 yearsBy V.P. Nandakumar On 14 February 2022, Manappuram Finance Limited published its results for the 3rd quarter ending December 2021. The key takeaway was that despite the impact of the omicron variant (which was particularly severe in December), we achieved good growth in our business volumes. Our consolidated AUM stood at Rs.30,400 crore, registering a sequential (or quarter-on-quarter) growth of 7 per cent. In our core business of gold loans, the loan book crossed the Rs.20,000 crore landmark while our microfinance subsidiary’s portfolio surged past the Rs.7,000 crore mark. There was good growth in vehicle and equipment finance division which contributed over Rs.1,500 crore while our home loans subsidiary accounted for about Rs.800 crore in business. These figures were extensively reported in the media and it is not my intention to talk more about it now. Indeed, for the purpose of this article, I would like to focus on another number that did not get the attention it deserved. That number, also Rs.800 crore, is the business achieved by what we refer to internally as our ‘other verticals’ which mainly includes MSME loans besides micro-home finance and personal loans. Within this Rs.800 crore, the largest chunk of about Rs.350 crore is contributed by MSME loans followed by micro home finance at about Rs.250 crore. At first sight, there is nothing remarkable about any line of business reaching a level of Rs.800 crore in a company where the total loan book is north of Rs.30,000 crore. But then, keep in mind that as late as three years ago, this business did not exist in our books. Yes, it was only in January 2019 that we kicked off this business with the first MSME loans disbursed to a small shop owner specializing in hardware at Angamaly, a small town close to where the Kochi airport is located. The start Having started MSME lending from a zero base in January 2019, we could easily see there was good demand for such loans. Accordingly, within a short period, we went ahead and scaled up the business to new geographies like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh etc. Our initial focus remained on the southern states where we targeted the local ‘Kirana’ shops and small industrial establishments. We were careful to exercise due care when vetting the loan applications and in this we were helped by our pool of existing gold loan customers who gave us good leads about quality borrowers. Interestingly, we started this new line of business without recruiting anyone from the market with prior experience in MSME lending. Instead, the employees were selected from our home-grown gold loan employees based on their connect with the relevant micro-markets, and after assessing their aptitude to handle this new line of business. We also chose to explore a different path by recruiting fresh youngsters as field sales representatives for the purpose of interfacing with quality MSME borrowers. We were confident that MSME lending would be one of the major growth areas for us given that entrepreneurship at the grassroots is taking off in a big way. To serve a broader range of customers, we started to offer a wider range of loan products across different categories – health care industry loans, small scale industrial finance, food industry loans, restaurant finance etc. We disburse fully secured loans and only for business purpose. The maximum loan amount was limited to Rs. 15 lakhs for shops and establishments. The pandemic setback The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic from March 2020 onwards was a disaster for almost all sectors of the economy and the MSME sector was particularly hard hit. With rising uncertainty, the financial services sector went into a freeze and fresh lending slowed down to a trickle. The squeeze on working capital coupled with the disruption to their regular activities from the lockdowns played havoc with their cash flows and resulted in non-payment of loan EMIs. Many of the MSMEs were on the verge of downing their shutters. The pandemic disrupted our disbursements and its negative impact on asset quality affected sentiments and morale. For a brief period, we had to stop fresh disbursements as we focused on collections instead. However, by June 2020 things began to look up, and we became active in the market once again to resume disbursement of loans. By this time, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had come out with its guidelines on the moratorium to be extended to borrowers affected by the pandemic. Accordingly, we too extended a moratorium to our eligible borrowers facing genuine challenges. Against the backdrop of a sharp fall in business, most MSMEs were faced with an acute cash crunch at this point, and they needed immediate liquidity to tide over the situation. The disruptions gave us an excellent opportunity to serve these MSMEs by speedily catering to their urgent requirement of working capital. We seized the opportunity and expanded the business to the rest of India, adding states like Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana etc. Keeping NPAs in check Perhaps the most important factor in any lending business is its asset quality, and how successful you are in holding down non-performing assets (NPAs). An important factor that enabled us to maintain good asset quality is our use of novel methods for loan appraisal. Before sanctioning any loan, we thoroughly analyse the repayment behaviour of the applicant. It helps us to assess the credibility and financial status of the borrower and that is taken to their credit score. After the loan is disbursed, we provide our customer with user friendly online payment options like Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe etc. so that loan repayments can be made easily, thus improving our collections. Further, we have established collection and customer relations team to exclusively cater to MSME borrowers and they have played a crucial role in holding down our cheque bounce rate to below 4 per cent, and the NPA level to well below 5 per cent despite the severe challenges of the pandemic. It may also be mentioned that the NPA level for the total portfolio (i.e., MSME and other verticals put together) is less than 3 per cent. As things stand today Today, Manappuram’s MSME and other verticals boast of customers from many states across India. Tamil Nadu contributes around one-fourth of the total business. We have more than 10,000 satisfied MSME customers and this portfolio generates a yield of about 21 per cent. The collection efficiency stands at more than 100 per cent including advance collections. We take special pride in having built a hardcore MSME portfolio of over Rs. 350 crore from scratch in three years, even as the last two years saw major disruptions from the pandemic. We did not hire any senior managers from the market as the entire business is managed by employees from our gold loans side. When we set out to do this, many questions were raised about whether employees from gold loans would be competent enough to run the show given that they lacked experience in credit appraisal, cash-flow analysis, or the valuation of non-gold security. Today, we have been able to demonstrate that business can be done differently without having to adhere to the conventional path. We have proved that the market can be wrong in many of its preconceived risk perceptions, such as the belief that when starting a new line of business you require people with industry experience, or that each business would require a separate HR, a distinct business culture etc. We now expect that business from the MSME and other verticals will approach the Rs. 1,000 crore milestone by the end of this fiscal year, and thereafter cross Rs.5,000 crore within five years. In the post Covid environment, we have seen for ourselves the grim situation that small enterprises across India find themselves in due to the sudden fall in business. Unlike large and medium enterprises that have access to institutional finance, small enterprises depend on regular cash flows for their sheer survival. They face an acute cash crunch and need immediate liquidity to help them survive in these challenging circumstance. It highlights the need for policy action to ensure the survival of small enterprises. The government should continue with its measures in support and see to it that small enterprises have uninterrupted access to liquidity to keep their businesses running and generate jobs for our workforce. Manappuram’s MSME business has made a strong start and we look forward to becoming a part of this process of keeping our small enterprises humming.

Benefits of taking a Gold Loan in 2022 | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Benefits of taking a Gold Loan in 2022 February 22, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share India is one of the world's largest gold importers. Gold is regarded as having significant value and a possible source of future financial appreciation. However, few people know that gold can also be used to meet short-term cash needs. Gold loans are now available in various banks and non-banking financial organizations (NBFCs). When you need immediate cash, these loans might come in helpful and can be obtained in a hassle-free manner. Here are a few reasons why you should take a loan against gold.1.Minimal Processing Time and FeeA gold loan is a secured loan with a very short disbursement period. The money is usually credited to the borrower's account within 24 to 48 hours. Processing fees for loans against gold are as low as nil, while some lenders charge 0.10 percent to 1% of the loan amount.2.No-income Proof to be ProvidedIn most loans against gold, gold loan companies don't ask for income proof from borrowers since the loan is secured against the gold pledged by the borrower.3.'Pay Interest Only' OptionLoans against gold frequently have a one-of-a-kind policy that allows the borrower to pay only the interest component while repaying the loan. The primary component might be paid at the end of the loan term or during the loan closing process to gold loan companies.4.Interest RatesThe interest rate is lower because gold loans are secured loans, starting at 9.90 percent. The bank lowers the interest on the gold loan for applicants who can supply additional collateral. For a borrower, this means that taking out a gold loan is less expensive than taking out a personal loan. Even if they are built for the same amount of money, repaying gold loans is easier than repaying personal loans owing to the interest on gold loans. Gold rates are at an all-time high, and experts think they will rise even more. As such, this makes a perfect time to apply for a loan as the gold loan per gram rate will be at a high.5.Minimal Foreclosure FeesSome banks and lenders don't charge prepayment fees on the gold loan per gram rate. Or if they do, they charge them at a low rate of 1%.6.Poor Credit History is not an issueThe bank determines the loan amount based on the borrower's repayment abilities and credit history in most loans. This is not the case in loans with gold as collateral, though. Since gold is used, lenders are confident in the repayment of the principal component and do not base their decision on the borrower's credit history. An applicant can get a gold loan even if they cannot make payments on their previous debts or repay a financial obligation.7.Physical Gold SecurityIt is the lender's responsibility to keep the physical gold safe. Borrowers do not have to worry about it because it is generally kept safe in the bank's vault. The bank returns the gold once the principal amount and interest of the gold loan are repaid.ConclusionLoans with gold as collateral are simple to obtain. However, borrowers must ensure that they repay the principal amount and the interest on the gold loan on time, or the gold may be forfeited to the bank.

The outlook for gold in 2022 | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The outlook for gold in 2022 February 16, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share The outlook for gold in 2022By V.P. NandakumarGold ended the year 2021 with its price about 4% lower than its opening price for the year, closing at US$1,806/oz. This was despite a rally towards the year-end against the backdrop of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant which added to uncertainties. However, it was not enough to offset the weakness for much of the first half of the year. Rising opportunity costs (a booming equity market and higher bond yields) contributed to gold’s negative performance in the first half of the year, while rising risks, especially higher inflation, pushed gold higher towards the end of the year.Source: WGCAs newly developed vaccines were rolled out early in 2021, there was a renewed sense of optimism among investors and stock markets rallied. This had a negative impact on gold price as it led to outflows from gold ETFs. The rest of the year was essentially a tug of war between competing forces. The emergence of new variants of the Corona virus together with the persistence of inflation gave renewed momentum to the demand for gold, pushing its prices up. On the other hand, the prospect of rising interest rates and a stronger US dollar continued to be headwinds for gold.Outlook for 2022​These days, the US Federal Reserve is increasingly signalling a more hawkish stance to bring the current high inflation under control. Market analysts have now veered around to the view that the Fed will hike interest rates four or five times this year beginning from March, which is a much faster pace than expected earlier. Further, there is also serious talk about reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, in other words, a quantitative tightening that would cut down liquidity in the market. However, the record with previous tightening cycles suggests that the Fed tends to talk tough while acting with moderation. Therefore, there is a view that the Fed may not tighten monetary policy as aggressively as they are hinting at now.Importantly, the expectations of the financial market about future monetary policy actions (as indicated by bond yields) have a major influence on gold price. As bond yields go up, which is quite likely in a scenario of tightening monetary policy, the opportunity cost of holding a non-interest-bearing asset like gold goes up, and its price tends to weaken. However, in the current scenario, where the anticipated tightening of monetary policy takes place against the backdrop of surging inflation, it remains to be seen whether gold will indeed shed value the way the theory predicts. The fact is, with US inflation currently running at 7%, even after the Fed hikes rates four or five times in a row, the real interest rate (i.e., adjusted for inflation) would continue to be deeply in negative territory.Further, as per the analysis carried out by the World Gold Council (WGC), gold has historically performed well amid high inflation. In years when inflation was higher than 3%, gold’s price increased 14% on average. In the long run, gold has outpaced US inflation and moved more in tune with money supply (M2), which has significantly increased in recent years as shown in the below chart Source: WGC gold outlook 2022Despite the prospect of impending rate hikes by the US Fed and some other central banks, nominal rates will remain low from a historical perspective. Further, as mentioned above, high inflation holds down real rates. This is important as gold’s short and medium-term performance is more closely tied to real rates, which combine the two important drivers of gold performance: “opportunity cost” and “risk and uncertainty”. It is commonly believed that the price of gold is determined by investment demand, especially from financial instruments such as gold ETFs, over-the-counter contracts, or exchange-traded derivatives. This is only partly true. An analysis by the World Gold Council (WGC) shows that gold’s performance is also linked to other components of demand, such as jewellery, technology, and central banks. While these do not typically result in the large price movements associated with investment demand, they provide steady support and ensure a minimum level of demand to hold up prices at the bottom of the range. Accordingly, gold can still receive moderate support in 2022 from key jewellery markets, such as India. Also, demand for gold from central banks which bounced back in 2021 may remain as a factor supporting gold price. Central banks have good reasons to favour gold as part of their foreign reserves given the current ultra-low interest rate environment. Even if US interest rates rise, high inflation will keep real interest rates down in the negative territory.Gold price forecasts by leading market analystsThe predictions about gold prices for 2022 are quite varied as usual. The broader opinion among analysts is that gold will struggle to maintain its current levels. They believe that the economic recovery will continue to gain ground, limiting the potential upside gains for gold.ANZ Bank and Singapore’s OCBC Bank are forecasting that the strength of the economic recovery will see gold fall to $1,500 - $1,600 per ounce as tapering begins and interest rates rise. UBS Global Wealth Management and Reuters predict that gold price in 2022 will average between $1,700 - $1,800 per ounce maintaining the levels of 2021.In its commodities outlook report, Fitch Solutions also sees gold prices averaging lower in 2022, as the US dollar strengthens, and bond yields continue the climb higher. Their forecast is of gold prices averaging US$1,700 per ounce in 2022 with considerable volatility. Earlier, they had forecast a price of US$1,800 per ounce for 2021 which was quite on the mark. But now, their position is that while gold will get support in the near term from the current inflation running at a multi-decade high, this will be countered by the risk of the US Fed raising interest rates at a faster pace than expected by the market.J.P. Morgan Global Research has a more pessimistic outlook as they expect gold prices to fall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. This is based on their view that the unwinding of the ultra-accommodative central bank policy will be outright bearish for gold in 2022. From an average of $1,765/oz in the first quarter, i.e., quarter ending March 2022, they predict that gold prices will steadily decline over the year to a fourth (December) quarter average of $1,520/oz.ABN Amro’s outlook for gold in 2022 is even more bearish as they expect the yellow metal to average $1,500 and fall further to an average of $1,300 in 2023. Scotiabank’s gold forecast sees a move back above the $1,800 level to average $1,850 in 2022 but decline to $1,700 in 2023.Here in India, Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a more optimistic take as it believes gold could touch $2,000 over the next 12–15 months. Their recommendation is that any price correction should be used as an opportunity to buy gold. In the short-term, they expect gold to reach about $1,915 this quarter going up thereafter to $1,965, with strong support seen in the $1,800 to $1,745 zone.A final thoughtAs we enter 2022, there are two powerful forces acting in opposite directions that will determine the gold price trend for the year. On the one hand, it is all but certain that the US Fed will start increasing interest rates from March onwards. What remains to be seen is how aggressively they proceed with the rate hikes and the normalisation of monetary policy. There is a view gaining ground that the process should be kicked off with a 50 bps hike rather than the conventional 25 bps move. Should the Fed opt for faster and more aggressive tightening, gold price will come under pressure. On the other hand, the US economy has been facing high inflation at levels last seen four decades ago. The experience with inflation around the world is that once the genie gets out of the bottle, the process of putting it back in is invariably drawn out and painful.With current US inflation running at 7%, it may be a little too optimistic to expect that the Fed Funds rate going up from zero to 1.5% or even 2% will do the trick, unless it tips the economy over into a recession by destroying demand. Indeed, at the first signs of trouble, such as rising unemployment and a sharp slowdown in GDP growth rates, we may reasonably expect the US Fed to ease off its tightening process. Should something like this happen, gold prices will bounce back. The key factor to watch out for is how far and how fast the US Fed goes with its rate hikes. While the intention at the start of the process would be to bring down inflation to the 2% level that’s been the Fed’s target for long, the question remains whether the Fed would stay committed to this goal if the costs turn out to be too heavy.Finally, adding to all the uncertainty is the future of crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There’s no doubt that crypto currencies have attracted a fair share of investments from players who are fundamentally sceptical about fiat currency and all the money printing taking place globally. Had it not been for the rise of crypto currency, this money would have flown into gold which is otherwise the natural hedge against inflation. The question now is, how long will the crypto boom last? If the bubble were to burst any time soon, it will lead to more money coming into gold and that would become a powerful tailwind for gold price. So, how soon can we expect the crypto bubble to burst? For now, there’s little that can be said with certainty. It’s been well said before that the market can stay irrational longer than you and I can stay solvent.

Here’s Why You Should Go For Gold Loan This Year | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Here’s Why You Should Go For Gold Loan This Year February 10, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share A gold loan is a secured loan where the borrower keeps the gold with a bank or financial institution and avails money against it. A gold loan is similar to a mortgage loan where the owner keeps their house or any asset as a mortgage with the bank to take a loan against it. A loan against gold serves as a source of instant supply when a person needs capital immediately. A person applying for a gold loan should know all the pros and cons associated with this type of loan.Who Should Opt For Gold Loan?1.People With Short-term Fund RequirementGold loans serve to fulfill short-term requirements for funds, and it is used as a common working capital loan in business. The gold loan is preferred against a personal loan from a gold loan bank with negative interest rates on a comparative basis.2.People With Low Credit ScoreA piece of jewellery acts as collateral against the loan taken from the bank. People with low credit scores opt for loans against gold because the bank is comfortable advancing loans to the people with low credit scores.3.People Who Have Gold But Are Taking Personal LoanPeople often go for personal loans even when they have gold lying ideals in their lockers. Instead of considering a personal loan with a short time duration, they should prefer a gold loan, and taking up a gold loan shall save the interest cost.4.People Opting For Loan Against Gold From Unorganised SectorIt is seen that people prefer taking a gold loan from the unorganized sector in fear of rejection from organized financial institutions. They feel that the financial institutions and gold loan banks might not provide them with loans because of their poor credit score history. In such scenarios, these people pay costly interest, which ranges between 25% to 50% per annum. But this may not be a great idea.Advantages Of Taking A Gold LoanGold loans are handy and can be sourced in a hassle-free way. A loan is available against gold in the form of jewellery. Some of the main benefits of a loan against gold are as follows:1.Quick ProcessingPhysical gold is considered collateral in any gold loan company or financial institution. It becomes easy for the banks to provide loans in such a scenario. Lending against gold is a safer option for the lender as they can sell the gold if the borrower fails to repay. The processing time taken is minimal and adds to the borrower's convenience.2.Lower Rate Of InterestGold loans are a form of secured loans. The bank charges a lower interest rate compared to other unsecured loans such as personal loans. The interest rates range around 12% to 14% per annum.3.No Impact Of Poor Credit HistoryFinancial institutions grant a loan to borrowers based on their repayment capability and credit score history. It is not case with a gold loan where gold jewellery is used as collateral to secure the loan. While providing gold loans, the lenders are assured about repayment of the principal amount. They do not have to depend on the borrower's credit history score before providing the loan.4.Security Of Physical GoldThe lender who provides the loan has the responsibility of safely maintaining the physical gold of the borrower. The physical gold is kept safe in the bank's vault, and therefore the borrower does not have to worry regarding its security. Once the borrower repays the loan, the gold is returned.5.Pay Interest Only OptionThe gold loans come with option to pay only the interest until the maturity. In this feature, the borrower only pays the interest amount monthly. The principal amount can be paid back by the borrowers once they settle the outstanding in the loan account.6.Zero Processing FeesA few NBFCs like Manappuram Finance Ltd. do not charge any processing fees from the people applying for gold loans and nor do they levy prepayment charges. Since the gold loan is kept as a mortgage, the borrowers get the loan amount instantly. Some banks offering gold loan levy minimal prepayment charges of 1% on gold loans.Features Of A Gold Loan1.Interest RateThe rate of interest on gold loans varies and depends on the financial institution and the scheme. The interest rate on gold loans provided by banks and financial institutions ranges from 8% to 18% per annum in the public sector, and these interest rates can go up to 25% per annum in the private sector.2.Loan To Value RatioThe guidelines of RBI state that a bank can provide a maximum of 75% of the value of gold as a loan amount. The actual loan to value ratio ranges between 60% to 70%, which implies that the banks keep a margin of 30% to 40%, making it safest for the gold loan companies. 3.TenureGold loan is short to medium-term loan. The tenure of a gold loan starts from about six months to 24 months, and it is not a long-term loan that the borrowers can take.4.Availability Of LoanGold is used as collateral against the capital. While providing gold loans, the lenders are assured about repayment of the principal amount. They do not have to depend on the borrower's credit history score before providing the loan. The gold loan banks are confident of sanctioning a loan even to those with a low credit score.5.The Weight Of Stones And Their Value Is Not CountedPrecious stones and jewellery have a high value in the market. But, while calculating the LTV for a gold loan, the lenders do not consider these precious stones. The value of gold alone is considered for the calculation of the loan.The Bottom LineA gold loan is considered amongst banks' profitable loans as it is free from worries about non-performing assets. Since jewellery and gold are taken as collateral with the gold loan companies, the lenders can sell off the gold if the borrower fails to repay the monthly instalments or the principal component. The concept of a gold loan should be understood properly to handle future necessities. With new variants coming up in the market each day, the borrowers should opt for gold loans as they effectively reduce the overall interest burden on the loan. The borrower should be aware of their repayment tenure as defaulting on loans can adversely affect the credit score. It can also lead to difficulties with any future loan application. Gold loan is the easiest and the fastest way to access funds in case of any medical emergencies or any other unforeseen circumstances.

Inflation is becoming a global phenomenon | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Inflation is becoming a global phenomenon January 19, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarThe US consumer price index rose 6.8% in November 2021 year on year, the fastest pace of increase since 1982, and the sixth straight month in which inflation topped 5%. Regular readers of this magazine may recall that in the August 2021 issue, my article titled “The US has an inflation problem” had dealt extensively with the subject of rising inflation in the US following the pandemic. In the five or six months since, the problem has become even more acute. In December 2021, responding to the high inflation, the US Federal Reserve announced a faster taper of its bond buying programme which has been injecting $120 billion of liquidity every month since June 2020. Bond purchases will now be reduced by $30 billion each month, which will end all fresh bond purchases by March 2022. The accelerated timetable puts the Fed on course to start raising interest rates in the first half of 2022.Here in India, inflation as measured by the wholesale price index (a proxy for producer prices) accelerated to 14.23% in November 2021, the highest since April 2005, due to a sharp increase in manufacturing costs and food prices. This has given rise to renewed concerns that rising inflationary pressures will soon have to be countered by the RBI raising interest rates. The gap between retail and wholesale price-based inflation has widened in recent months as many companies struggle to absorb surging input costs that undermine their profitability. Wholesale inflation has remained in double-digits for eight months in a row now while retail inflation continues to hover around 5%. It may just be a matter of time before the high WPI inflation spreads to consumer prices as well.A look around the worldSource: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/24/inflation-has-risen-around-the-world-but-the-u-s-has-seen-one-of-the-biggest-increases/The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization has said food prices globally are now at their highest levels in more than a decade. According to the International Monetary Fund, consumer prices could rise about 4.8% globally in the next year. As the world braces for higher inflation everywhere, here is a look at how the leading economies of the world are faring.China's consumer price index rose 2.3% year on year in November 2021 while the producer price index went up 12.9%. An ongoing crunch in energy supplies was the major contributor to the rise in producer price inflation as the cost of coal, a leading source of energy in the country, has risen sharply. The world's second largest economy is growing at the slowest pace in a year as the energy shortages, shipping disruptions, and a deepening real estate crisis take their toll. China’s rising inflation has the world worried considering China's place in the global supply chain and its role as the world's factory supplying a staggering range of goods to consumers around the world.In the U.K., inflation climbed to a 10-year high with CPI rising by 5.1% year on year in November, which was more than double the central bank’s target. The UK’s Office for National Statistics attributed the rise in inflation to the prices of petrol and second-hand cars, but prices have risen for almost all goods and services suggesting that price pressures are being felt across the economy. As inflation surged, the Bank of England hiked interest rates for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, increasing its main interest rate to 0.25% from its historic low of 0.1%. In Germany, inflation continued to rise going up from 4.5% in October to 5.2% in November (the highest rate registered in the country since June 1992) driven by the base effect of low prices that prevailed for much of 2020. The sharp fall in petroleum prices in 2020 along with a temporary reduction of value-added tax (VAT) had lowered prices during the year. Later, the introduction of a CO2 pricing in the transport and housing sectors at the beginning of 2021 (a charge of 25 euros, equivalent to US$ 28, per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted) and sharply higher energy prices (up 22.1 per cent year-on-year in November) added to the inflationary pressures.In France, inflation rose unexpectedly in November to hit its highest level in 13 years, according to a preliminary estimate. Consumer prices rose 0.4% from the previous month, amounting to an annualised inflation rate of 3.4%, the highest since September 2008. In line with the worldwide trend, the November increase was mostly driven by surging energy prices, which were up 21.6% over the last one year.While inflation surges around the world, Japan continues to be a notable exception. Although Japanese policymakers have long sought to stimulate the economy by increasing inflation and thereby shake it out of its long-term deflationary trend, consumer prices have not moved. It appears that after decades of very low inflation, Japanese shoppers tend to resist the idea of paying higher prices and businesses have refrained from raising prices. Consequently, companies tend to hoard cash and go slow on investments, while keeping the labour market rigid so that workers don’t get to change jobs easily or get pay increases. In October, Japan’s consumer prices increased by just 0.1% from a year earlier, while core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) actually fell by 0.7%. Interestingly, most of the inflationary forces hitting other countries, such as higher prices for oil, commodities, and microchips also apply to Japan. The difference lies in the way companies and consumers react. Japan has an aging and shrinking population that encourages people to be cautious with their spending leading to a chronic shortfall in consumer demand.Causes of current inflationWhy has inflation risen so quickly? The answer to this question holds the key to an understanding of how long the surge can be expected to last and what policymakers should do about it. Many economists believe that the recent bout of inflation is different from other inflationary periods that were linked to the regular business cycle. Among their explanations include the continuing disruptions in global supply chains after the pandemic, the unsettled labour markets, the base effect from measuring prices against the low levels that prevailed last year after COVID-19 had shut down parts of the economy, and the strong rebound in consumer demand after local economies were reopened.Supply chain issues: If inflation today has become something of a global phenomenon, the havoc wreaked by the pandemic on global supply chains gets a fair share of the blame. By constricting supplies of a range of goods at a time when pent-up demand is looking for an outlet, it has set the spark to inflation on a global level. In hindsight, it is no surprise that a globalized economy where manufacturing is dispersed across multiple locations often in different countries (and therefore dependent on smooth and efficient logistics to keep going) can come to a freeze when struck by a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Covid-19 squeezed supply chains, restricted international and local travel, and shut down businesses and services. Now, even as the world is recovering from these shocks, new variants of Covid-19 continue to pose a threat.Shipping costs: The Global shipping crisis—as seen in the severe shortage of containers and ships having to wait for long to dock at ports—is likely to go on delaying goods traffic and stoking inflation by increasing the cost of logistics. Shipping has rarely been a subject to attract the attention of economists who have always paid more attention to raw material and labour costs as compared to transportation. But those days may be over. The cost of shipping a 40-foot container (FEU) unit used to be about $1,300 before the pandemic. It surged to a record high of over $11,000 in September 2021 but has now come down by about 15% according to the Freightos FBX index. With 90% of the world's merchandise being shipped by sea, soaring shipping costs are exacerbating global inflation.Petroleum prices: Energy prices are rising around the world with the economic recovery and people returning to the offices. Europe is struggling to secure enough gas and coal with the onset of winter. Soaring gas and oil prices hurt consumption and aggravate inflation. The gas market is going through a turbulent phase which has driven prices in Europe higher by 280% this year while comparable US prices have doubled. The spike is being attributed to a range of factors from low storage levels to reduced Russian supplies and lower investments in hydrocarbons. Also at fault is the aggressive implementation of green energy policies that deter investments in the hydrocarbon sector. A side effect of surging gas prices is higher food costs as the production of fertiliser uses gas as a feedstock.Commodity prices: The spike in the prices of commodities, especially steel, aluminium and metals like copper and zinc, has cast a shadow over the recovery and added to the inflationary pressures. The profit margins for manufacturers shrink when raw material costs go up. Households are paying more for gas, groceries and eating out, which constricts their ability to spend elsewhere. Surging commodity prices are an early warning of future inflation as commodity markets react more quickly to changes in economic conditions than prices for final goods.Shortage of semiconductors: The worldwide shortage in the supply of semiconductors has affected manufacturing and is yet another reason for the upward pressure on consumer prices. In the modern world, semiconductors are at the heart of products ranging from computers and phones to our vehicles and appliances. Orders for everything from cars to televisions to touch-screen computers and the like are being held back for six months and more merely for want of adequate chips. With production of new cars impacted by the semiconductor shortage (modern cars make use of a lot of electronics), manufacturers have pushed up prices which has spilled over into the used car market. As the supply of semiconductors increases, we may expect some easing of inflation on this count, but the process is likely to be drawn out.Fiscal and monetary stimulus: This is the elephant in the room that most policymakers would prefer not to see. The massive amounts of liquidity injected into the global economy through fiscal and monetary stimulus by central banks around the world to lend support to the economic recovery has had some unintended consequences too. As the famous definition goes, inflation is too much money chasing too few goods and services. Approximately US$10.8 trillion was injected into the world economy by way of fiscal stimulus and this is equivalent to 10% of global GDP. With so much extra money finding its way into the economy in a short period, high inflation was perhaps a foregone conclusion.Consequences and likely outcomes​The tapering of bond purchases by the US Fed followed by a faster lift-off of interest rates will put pressure on stock prices in the US as well as emerging markets where the risk off mode will lead to foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) flowing out. In fact, FPIs have pulled out Rs.29,702 crore from the Indian equity and debt markets in December 2021 which saw the announcement of faster tapering by the US Fed as well as uncertainty over the Omicron variant. Gold prices will likely be under pressure initially as reduced stimulus and interest rate hikes by central banks tend to push government bond yields up, raising the opportunity cost of holding bullion which yields no interest. However, there is no certainty that US inflation can be brought under control without raising interest rates to the point where the economy tips over into a recession, and that means there’s a lot more fight left in gold.Back in 2017 and 2018, the US Fed had raised interest rates seven times in a row but when growth slowed, they changed course and cut interest rates again. At the time, inflation was low and that gave the Fed the room to revert to lower interest rates. However, this time around, inflation is at a four-decade high and if the Fed were to reverse course without fully wringing out inflation, the pressures can mount leading to stagflation. And should inflation remain stubborn, gold prices will likely bounce back as the metal has historically done well under high inflation.In India, the RBI will be under pressure to hike interest rates to curb inflation. This will put pressure on the financial services sector which typically does better under a low interest rate regime. For now, the RBI has been patient with measures to support growth. Once growth recovers, the focus will shift to inflation. With domestic inflation risks on the upside, and with global interest rates also going up, interest rates in India are set to increase. A rising interest rate cycle is a challenge for bond market investors especially those investing in longer maturity bonds as capital losses are higher for longer holding periods as compared to shorter duration bonds.As for the equity markets, they have perhaps delivered their due ahead of time considering the record gains since the lows of the pandemic. A period of consolidation is more likely than a repetition of the outperformance of the last two years. However, given the unpredictability of the markets, it would also be wise to pray for an uneventful year without any more of black swan events to throw all our calculations out of gear.

The Sun Sets on an Iconic American Company | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The Sun Sets on an Iconic American Company October 11, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. Nandakumar The General Electric company (GE), one of the oldest and most well-known names in the corporate world that counts Thomas Alva Edison as one of its founders, is breaking up. On November 9, GE announced plans to split into three separate companies for its aviation, healthcare, and energy businesses. The news marks the end of an era. GE was incorporated in 1892 after a merger between the Edison General Electric Company, a company founded in 1878 by Thomas Edison, and the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. The deal was arranged by the influential financier J.P. Morgan. At its peak in early 2001, the company’s stock was worth more than $500 billion making it one of the most valuable companies in the world at that time. It was a giant global conglomerate in the true sense of the term, involved in commercial and consumer finance, infrastructure (water treatment systems, energy delivery systems such as power grids), diesel locomotives, jet engines, consumer appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, cooking ranges etc.), lighting products, health care (mainly diagnostic and imaging products), and also, for good measure, media and entertainment! However, in recent years, the company has struggled, particularly after the global financial crisis of 2008 left its financial services division, GE Capital, reeling. What was once an iconic American company and a Wall Street favourite, became a flat-footed giant unable to respond to or adjust to changing realities. A company that was an original constituent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average when it was launched in 1896, found itself ejected from the index in June 2018. In a way, GE’s decline is the outcome of a broader shift in the economy of the United States, which has drifted away from heavy industry and moved towards services, such as technology, finance, and health care. Snapshot of a company in declineGE’s stock has underperformed the market since the crisis; Share price and index rebased, January 2009.[Description: Chart, line chart Description automatically generated]Source: https://www.ft.com/content/1ca38b2c-a9ce-4450-b156-a17a24e33976 Jack Welch, legendary CEO No write up on General Electric can do without a mention of Jack Welch, its legendary CEO for 20 years from 1981 to 2001. Welch authored five bestselling books on leadership and inspired a generation of business leaders. During his tenure, the company was consistently ranked amongst the top companies in Fortune 500 list and its market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion. For Welch, GE was not merely a manufacturing company but a "boundary-less" business, and GE became a training ground for a growing cadre of star managers. They were developed and moved from one business to another every few years for better career growth though exposure to a wide range of businesses. Welch succeeded because he understood that growth is what moves Wall Street even as he realized that most of the “industrial” businesses GE was operating in had modest organic growth prospects. He therefore developed a strategy of acquisitions to grow earnings. He would look for performing businesses in a dominant position in industries where there were only three or four large players, which could be counted on to contribute to profit from day one. Once a company came into the GE fold, GE’s star managers would get down to work, in the quest to improve its workings for higher growth. Singularly determined to overcome the odds by shaking up the bureaucratic culture he had inherited, Welch earned two titles, “manager of the century,” and “Neutron Jack”, the latter for cutting back tens of thousands of jobs while acquiring, restructuring, and selling businesses. The allusion is to the neutron bomb which leaves buildings intact but decimates the population. Welch had a no-nonsense approach to profit. A GE business that wasn't the market leader in its segment was faced with three choices. The first was to work on the business and make it the leader. If not, it was either sold, or shut down. In his first two years as CEO, 71 businesses were sold. Welch also transformed GE Capital, a division originally meant to finance client purchases of its aircraft engines and power turbines, into a financial services powerhouse involved in everything from subprime mortgages to insurance. Ironically, within a decade of his retirement, amid the global financial crisis of 2008, GE Capital would prove to be a weak link and the source of much of its troubles. Lessons about corporate strategy from GE’s failure Not surprisingly, the story of GE’s fall from grace has been widely discussed in the media. A much talked about book in this context was published in 2020 with the title, “Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric.” Authored by Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann who are both journalists with the Wall Street Journal, the book traces GE’s decline from the days of Welch onwards. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, recently put out a short blog post about this book. He wrote about his key takeaways from the book and offered his own insights into what likely went wrong. (More about Gates’ thoughts shortly.) For this article, I would like to draw attention to an August 2019 case study authored by Dr. James E. Schrager, professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. The study is titled, “Three Strategy Lessons from GE’s Decline” and it explains what can happen to a conglomerate that fails to adapt quickly when its success wanes. Dr. Shrager is of the opinion that GE never stood much of a chance once Jack Welch retired as chairman and CEO in 2001. No, it was not due to poor luck or indifferent management, it’s just that Welch’s brilliant growth strategy had run its course and ceased to be relevant. Welch’s great mistake was to fail to plan for what happens when the golden goose stops laying. According to Dr. Schrager, the story of GE holds three powerful lessons about corporate strategy, which I quote below verbatim:All growth from any single market or technology will end. Companies that endure are those that plan for this reality.If you are successful, many will copy your success. Companies that continue to prosper update and adapt their strategies.Smart corporate strategies are flexible and nimble, enabling action rather than constraining it.Having laid out the strategic lessons, here is what Dr. Shrager recommends that current and future CEOs should take care of.1. Plan the next big thing: When Jack Welch presided over GE, his long-term and short-term views were not very different. In his vision of the future, he expected GE to continue acquiring promising companies at reasonable prices, thereby delivering uninterrupted growth with profitability. But by the time Welch ceded control to Jeff Immelt in 2001, the world had become a different place. The story of Welch’s success had been shared widely and many other business leaders adopted the same strategy, making it less effective over time. The lesson here is, no matter how big or successful you are today, no matter how much you dominate your sector, you must plan for a time when your current strategy no longer works. Change will always happen and so strategies must be renewed and revised. As Dr. Shrager puts it, “Corporate leaders need to ask themselves: What is the pipeline? What is driving growth? What are we going to run out of?”2. Expect competition: As mentioned earlier, Welch had developed a strategy of acquisitions to grow the company rapidly. However, once other companies too began to copy the same strategy, and once private-equity players emerged in the 1990s with the ability to raise huge capital and obtain funding from banks to finance their acquisitions, all the good candidates suddenly had too many interested parties looking to takeover. The bidding wars that followed pushed prices higher and higher, increasing the risk factor in the acquisition. Buying the right companies at the right prices became harder and harder. The lesson here is that market conditions change, successful companies will attract competitors, and competitors will copy your successful strategies and may even improve upon it, to make it cheaper, faster, or smarter. A good business leader should expect and plan for such competition well in advance. 3. Be nimble: Strategies are not meant to be etched in stone and held valid for all situations and times to come, nor should they become inflexible in ways that constrain action. Rather, strategies work best as frameworks for decision-making. The successful corporate strategies enable companies to change direction when things don’t go according to plan, and when unexpected opportunities arise too. Bill Gates on GE’s declineIn a blog post of June 2021, Bill Gates talks about his two big takeaways from the book, “Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric,” by Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann.Firstly, GE’s fall is a textbook case of mismanagement of an excessively complex business. As Gates explains, what seemed like one of GE’s greatest strengths was one of its biggest weaknesses. For many years, investors loved GE’s stock because the GE management team always “made their numbers,” which is to say the company would report earnings per share much in line with what Wall Street analysts predicted. However, as it became clear later, the culture of meeting the market’s expectations at all costs gave rise to “success theatre” and “chasing earnings.” Gates quotes an example from the book about how GE would sometimes artificially boost quarterly profits by selling an asset (e.g., a diesel locomotive) to a friendly bank on the understanding that GE would buy back the asset later. In this way, problems were brushed under the carpet for the sake of presenting a bright picture. However, it also allowed small problems to grow into big problems before they came to the attention of top management.Gates points out that in many companies, bad news travels very slowly while good news travels fast. He contrasts this with the culture at Microsoft where he tried hard to keep this tendency in check. As an example, he says that if a team member sent him an email saying, “we just won a software design competition,” he would typically respond with, “Why am I hearing about this one? That’s not statistically representative. How many competitions did we lose?” Gates calls it “making bad news travel fast” all the time so that he would catch negative trends early enough for top management to take corrective measures.Gates’ second key takeaway is that GE did not have the right managerial talent or systems to manage its wide range of complex and divergent businesses. The company liked to believe that its famous training systems made its managers more capable of avoiding the pitfalls that had brought down conglomerates in the past. The reality was not so simple as GE’s generalists often lacked in-depth knowledge about the industries they had to manage. Consequently, they were not always well-equipped to steer their way through the trends and upheavals in their industries. These limitations were severely exposed when it came to GE Capital, which almost collapsed during the global financial crisis of 2008. The failure happened because GE Capital was all along borrowing short at cheap rates (using the commercial paper route) and lending long at higher rates to boost profits. When the crisis broke, confidence in the financial system shattered overnight halting the flow of credit, and GE Capital had to be bailed out by Warren Buffet. Success not guaranteedMany conglomerates have split up in recent years based on the logic of enabling the more promising businesses to focus on the opportunities within their sector. Days after GE’s announcement, another big American company, Johnson & Johnson, announced plans to split into two parts, with its consumer business separating from its pharmaceutical and medical devices business.However, the results of such splits are not always on expected lines. A recent New York Times article cites the examples of Siemens AG and Honeywell to show how splitting a conglomerate can be a mixed bag. Siemens AG announced the spinoff of its energy business in May 2020. Since then, its shares have risen 64%, bettering the S&P 500’s 56% gain over this period. Honeywell announced the spinoff of its home equipment business In October 2017 but the gain in the company’s shares since has been outpaced by gains in the S&P 500 (63% vs 83%).Moreover, even after GE’s split, the three new stand-alone companies will still be reckoned as large companies in their own right. For example, the jet engine business earned a revenue of $22 billion last year. Reportedly, there are about 36,000 GE engines fitted on commercial airliners worldwide and another 26,000 engines on military aircraft. GE’s health care business recorded revenues of $17 billion last year and hospitals and clinics globally use 4 million of its imaging and other machines. The third company coming out of the split will hold GE’s energy and power business which manufactures wind turbines and gas-fuelled power generators. Astonishing as this may seem, GE’s power plants generate one-third of the world’s electricity today!For some years now, GE has been trying to extricate itself from its troubles by cutting down on debt and bringing more focus to its businesses. Hopefully, the split into three companies will make them nimbler. Published in Unique Times Magazine, December 2021 (V.P. Nandakumar is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.

The Rise of Retail Investors in India and the Us | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The Rise of Retail Investors in India and the Us November 10, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share When the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world in March 2020, panic swept through stock markets everywhere including India, and share prices tumbled across the board. However, the story since then has been quite different, as stock markets quickly went on to recoup their losses and post handsome gains thereafter. In India, the Nifty 50 has doubled from its March 2020 lows, driven both by foreign investors who put in $14 billion in FY 2021 and domestic inflows amounting to about $25 billion in the same period.The sheer strength of the bull market coming so soon after the despair of the pandemic has attracted millions of new investors into India’s stock market. According to the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), over 14 million new investors have entered the stock market in recent months. Before March 2020, there were around 11 million active investors in India. Since then, the number has more than doubled to around 25 million active investors. In September 2021, active demat accounts in India crossed the seven-crore landmark, highlighting the growing influence of retail investors in Indian equities. In fact, retail investors now command about 70 per cent of the market share in the average daily turnover while the turnover of institutions - including foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) - declined to 30 per cent from 59 per cent in March last year. Go further back and as late as May 2015, this share was as high as 89 per cent.Clearly, the rise of discount brokers like Zerodha, Upstox, Groww etc. have expanded the base of retail investors, as they have gained wide acceptance among the public with easier accessibility and lower costs. In comparison to traditional brokers and banks, they have succeeded in broadening the market base by tapping into people who either did not invest in stock markets or who did so only indirectly, for instance, through pension schemes. Their key selling point - low or no brokerage charges - has attracted many first-time investors from the smaller, less well-connected cities and towns, and their market share has increased from 26 to 44 per cent in the past year. Further, to extend their reach into the hinterlands, they offer their services in the regional languages as well. With discount brokers, ordinary investors have gained the confidence to invest small amounts in the stock market without fearing that their trading profits would be consumed by brokerage fees, as would happen with a traditional broker.Remarkably, the trend of the increasing importance of retail investors seen in India has an exact parallel in the US too. The lockdowns and the work-from-home concept that took hold served as a catalyst for many Americans who now began to think about investing in the stock market. As with India and discount brokerages like Zerodha, the US also saw the rise of a trading app called Robinhood which altered the rules of the game. Prior to Robinhood, anyone who wanted to invest in stocks was charged between $5 to $10 a trade. They were also required to invest a minimum of $500 to open a trading account. That changed when Robinhood disrupted the market with its zero-commission trading, smart and user-friendly interface, hassle-free account opening process, and making it possible to invest in fractional shares.According to informed estimates, retail investors accounted for 23 per cent of all US equity trading in 2021 which is more than twice the level of 2019. That suggests that their stock market presence is roughly as big as all hedge funds and mutual funds combined and behind only the high-frequency traders. A Deutsche Bank survey found that almost half of US retail investors were completely new to the markets in the past year. They are young (mostly under 34) and they are aggressive, as seen in their greater willingness to borrow money to fund their bets, to make heavy use of options to make bets on stocks, and to use social media as a research tool to gain trading insights.What explains the rise of retail investors?An important factor in the rise of retail investors is that lockdowns and the work from home lifestyle gave people extra time to explore the stock markets. They were then nudged into actual trading thanks to online discount brokerages like Zerodha in India and Robinhood in the US. Further, India has seen a dramatic rise in its 4g network coverage and data consumption. The exponential growth in smartphone usage has allowed Indians to access all kinds of financial services efficiently and without hassles. As of March 2021, India had the second largest number of internet users in the world with almost 825 million people actively using the internet each month. The Ericsson Mobility Report 2021 puts the total number of smartphone subscriptions in India at 810 million in 2020, accounting for 72 per cent of total mobile phone users in the country last year.However, when it comes to altering the behaviour of millions of disconnected individuals and that too in such a short period of time, we need more than the existence of enabling factors. We need something that sets off a spark and lights the fire. Around the time the world went into lockdown mode in March/ April of 2020, share prices had collapsed dramatically and shares of many good companies were available at compelling valuations. Many retail investors who first entered the market in that period would have made handsome gains subsequently, thereby increasing their own appetite for more and also serving as successful examples to others, and draw in more investors.Further, in the US, generous welfare payments were handed out by the Federal and state governments to their citizens which meant that many people had money in their bank accounts, but without avenues for spending the same given the lockdowns and travel restrictions. Trading in the stock market became an alternative channel to deploy some of this money. Besides, it goes without saying that one’s risk appetite is always greater when trading with money that comes into hand as an unexpected bonus, as compared to money that is earned by the sweat of the brow.Back in India, interest rates on bank deposits were reduced along with lending rates as part of the measures to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic. With low returns on conventional bank deposits, investors have been looking out for alternative channels to deploy their savings in search of higher returns. Also, the process of financialization of savings had begun earlier with demonetisation and the implementation of GST causing money to shift away from gold and real estate and into mutual funds which have seen record inflows in recent years. The amount of money flowing into equities through Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) has surged in recent years, pointing to the growing awareness about mutual funds. Average inflows into systematic investment plans (SIPs) more than doubled between 2016 and 2020, going up from Rs.3,500 crore to Rs.8,100 crore a month.The good and the badObjectively speaking, the rise of retail investors in the stock market is a positive development. The historical trend across countries shows that stock markets deliver the greatest returns compared to other assets like bank deposits or gold. With greater retail participation, more common people stand to benefit from the greater gains delivered by the stock market. In a way, it’s about democratising the markets and making it less of an elite phenomenon. Over the past decade, the Nifty50 Total Return Index or TRI has compounded at 11 per cent per annum and created $1 trillion of wealth. The stock market has therefore become a potent source of sustainable wealth creation in India. It stands to reason that if the wealth created by the stock market spreads more equitably across all classes, it will give free-market reforms a greater degree of acceptance and legitimacy than has been the case so far.Furthermore, in a country where a mere 5 per cent of household wealth is held in the form of financial assets, stock market investments can drive the financialization of savings and wealth. That benefits the macro-economy as financial savings contribute much more to economic activity than savings in real assets like gold or real estate. When savings flow into financial assets be it bank deposits, government and corporate bonds, mutual funds, or direct investments in the equity market, the funds remain within the banking system and available for economic activity.On the negative side, investments in stock markets carry a higher degree of risk which the common investor may not appreciate, particularly the younger investors who may not have experienced economic downturns or the cyclical ups and downs of the market. Such investors may not be able handle the down-cycles and are more likely to exit the market during downturns after incurring steep losses. However, seasoned investors understand that downturns are frequent occurrences in the stock market to be taken in stride and not a trigger for panic selling.Retail investors are also more likely to follow the momentum of the market, which means they end up buying when the market is peaking. In this case too, the investor ends up making little or no money from his investments. In this context, retail investor behaviour is often characterised by two significant biases termed the ‘disposition effect’ and ‘overconfidence effect’. The ‘disposition effect’ is the tendency of investors to sell assets in which they have registered gains while continuing to hold assets in which they are making losses in the hope that they would register profits in time. This is reinforced by the ‘overconfidence effect’ which is the tendency to recognise gains and feel elated about successful trades, while ignoring losses and continuing to hold on to a loss-making stock in the expectation of a turnaround.Also, the recent behaviour of retail investors in the US stock markets suggests that retail investors are more prone to chasing momentum. They seem to be at a greater risk of investing in high-priced stocks whose prices may have entered bubble territory. In fact, there is empirical evidence to show that individual investors who pick their own stocks for investment would earn poorer long-run returns in aggregate and are therefore better off investing in a low-cost index fund. This poor performance becomes more apparent when we include transaction costs such as commissions, bid–ask spreads, market impact, and transaction taxes. However, while transaction costs undermine returns, a more relevant consideration is the poor security selection ability of the average individual investor. Therefore, it is important to strengthen investor education with a focus on sensible investment practices that ensure returns in the long run.Published in Unique Times Magazine, November 2021(V.P.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Mistakes you make while purchasing gold that may affect your gold loan November 09, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share A loan against gold or gold loan has been the most-opted finance option. The past couple of years registered a quantum leap in the increase in the number of gold loans in the country.

As you understand, a loan against gold is a secured type of loan. The lender would be auctioning the gold in case the borrower fails to repay the gold loan. Per gram gold loan would be higher if the gold you pledge is good quality BIS Hallmarked one.On the other hand, per gram gold loan value would go down significantly in the case of gold that lacks quality and purity. Gold loan per gram would be directly proportional to the Karat rating and the quality of the gold being mortgaged. Many financiers do approve gold loans if the gold is not pure. Whereas, the subject characteristics may not affect the interest of gold loan when you approach a trustworthy financer. A loan against gold is the top finance option in India nowadays.Things You Must Check While Purchasing GoldYou must confirm that the gold you purchase is of standard quality and the requisite markings are there that affirm the same.

It is observed to be the only authorized agency by the Government of India, for testing and marking the quality seal (BIS Hallmark). The gold with BIS hallmarking would get you more money per gram on gold loan than the gold ornament without the subject marking. A voluntary option, leading jewellers in Kerala/ India confirms with the BIS quality standard and use the marking as a marketing tool. A loan against gold would be easy with the BIS hallmarked gold. As we have stated in the preceding paragraphs, the interest of gold loans would not vary based on the markings.2. Karat and Fineness22 karat or 91.6 (the percentage of gold) are the standard purity ratings of the gold ornaments. A karat rating of 24 karats is considered pure gold. However, it cannot be used for manufacturing jewellery. An ornament bought from a reputed and reliable jeweller will have 22 k marking, fineness number, and BIS markings on it. Such conformity will assure you the best value per gram on gold loan.

The best way is to ask the gold loan company or the gold loan bank to clarify how much would be the financial burden as interest on gold loan.

The Phenomenal Rise of Esg Investing Has a Flip Side | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The Phenomenal Rise of Esg Investing Has a Flip Side October 29, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share By V. P. NandakumarThese days, we hear a lot about a trend in the markets called ESG investing, and about all the money flowing into it globally. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, being the three broad areas of concern that drive certain market players who regard themselves as “socially responsible investors.” They believe in going beyond the traditional concerns related to the profitability and risks of the business to also give due importance to ESG factors when evaluating an investment opportunity. On the face of it, there appears nothing wrong in looking beyond narrow considerations of profitability at larger factors such as the impact of the business on the environment and the society. But then, my curiosity was piqued when Mr. Aswath Damodaran, a well-known professor of finance at the Stern School of Business (New York University), created a stir recently by writing that the growing trend of ESG investing would end up costing companies and investors dearly. Without mincing words, he declared that ESG is a mistake that will cost companies and investors money, while making the world worse off as it creates more harm than good for society.But before going into Mr. Damodaran’s critique of ESG, let’s first look at what ESG investing is all about, and why so many are convinced it is the future of investing.Environmental: There is no doubt that our environment faces the risk of continuing deterioration from various factors such as the burning of fossil fuels or the indiscriminate use of plastic. The earth’s forest cover is steadily eroding while our seas and rivers are polluted with toxic wastes which imperils the fragile ecological balance of our water bodies. With growing emissions of carbon dioxide, global warming is a reality which causes our glaciers to melt so much that we face the prospect of rising sea levels submerging low lying coastal areas in the not-too-distant future. Therefore, it stands to order that companies that choose to adhere to the best practices for energy conservation and preserving the environment deserve our encouragement.Social: Businesses have a common tendency to focus narrowly on their profits. When making more profit becomes the paramount objective, companies may engage in unhealthy and unethical practices. Essentially a business deploys the various factors of production such as land, water, raw materials, labour, capital etc. to produce goods and services of value. In the quest to maximize output and profits, these resources can be used irresponsibly, as happens when labour is exploited without paying just wages, or when pollutants are discharged into water bodies without the requisite treatment to save on costs.Corporate Governance: It’s a fact that corporate governance lies at the heart of a modern-day business, and it refers to the processes, practices and policies followed by a company’s directors and executives related to all the decision-making that go into managing the company. Investors are well-advised to invest in companies that adhere to high standards of corporate governance because the evidence reveals that companies that value transparency and compliance with statutory norms show better prospects for sustainable growth. Good corporate governance helps companies build trust with investors as also with all other stakeholders. Consequently, corporate governance helps promote financial viability by creating a long-term investment opportunity for market participants. What’s more, by adhering to higher standards of compliance and transparency, a company minimizes the risk of a major fraud or scandal that can put the whole business at risk. In this way, the business also become more “sustainable.” Recent trends in ESG investingESG investing has been growing steadily over the last few years and the recent pandemic has accelerated the trend. It is reported that globally about US$2.96 trillion is currently invested in funds that carry the ESG tag. Global inflows into sustainable funds went up by 88% in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020 to cross $150 billion. Europe accounted for about 80% of these inflows, the US share stood at $13.4 billion, while flows for Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, and Asia combined stood at $11.1 billion. According to a report by the Climate Bond Initiative, global issuance of green bonds is on track to reach between $400 billion and $500 billion in 2021, nearly double the record high of $270 billion in 2020. In India, ESG investing is still in its early stages. However, it is rapidly gaining ground with mutual funds pushing it with young investors. Inflows into ESG funds increased by 76% to ₹3,686 crore in FY21 against ₹2,094 crore in FY20. ESG funds together had an asset base of nearly ₹9,900 crore at the end of FY 2021. The increasing inflows are said to point to growing investor interest as the disruption caused by the pandemic draws attention to the need for sustainable and resilient business models that respond to multiple stakeholders. What’s the flip side?I began this article by referring to Prof. Aswath Damodaran’s critique of ESG investing. A common criticism of the concept of ESG investing has to do with its lack of precision, and the fact that it can accommodate many different investing strategies within its ambit. For example, there were 400 climate-focused funds at the end of 2020, sub-divided into five different categories: low carbon, climate conscious, green bond, climate solutions and clean energy/ technology.It’s also pointed out that the bar for what constitutes a good corporate citizen is quite low. Contrary to what many investors think, most ESG ratings have little to do with corporate responsibility towards ESG factors. Instead, what is sought to be measured is the degree to which a company’s economic value is at risk due to ESG factors. It’s been pointed out that a polluting company can still get a respectable ESG score if the rating agency takes the view that the pollution is managed well and that there is no risk to the company’s market value.Champions of ESG investing often point to studies suggesting that there is a positive relationship between ESG performance and financial performance, with ESG compliant companies likely to deliver higher profits and better returns for investors. However, critics point out that such positive linkages are tenuous and sensitive to how profits are measured and over what period. Often, the positive correlation is based on a ratings methodology which makes it easy to obtain good scores without much effort. In this context, Prof. Aswath Damodaran sees a weak link between ESG and operating performance (growth and profitability) as the notion that adding an ESG constraint to investing will increase expected returns is counter intuitive. He says that while some firms benefit from being good, many do not. The evidence is stronger that bad firms get punished, either with higher funding costs or with a greater incidence of disasters and shocks. “ESG advocates are on much stronger ground telling companies not to be bad, than telling companies to be good,” he concludes.Prof. Damodaran also counters the implicit presumption that unless companies are explicitly committed to ESG, they cannot contribute to society. He points to the examples of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett as two businessmen who built hugely valuable companies that would have considered goodness as a factor in their decision making only if it was good for their business (i.e., without allowing extraneous considerations to affect their decision-making). Having done that, they have both committed to donating a substantial portion of their wealth to charitable causes and they have also made their shareholders wealthy, with many shareholders going on to give money back to society. According to Prof. Damodaran, the difference between the “old” model of business exemplified by Gates and Buffet and the “new ESG” version lies in who does the giving back to society, with corporate CEOs and management taking over that responsibility from shareholders.Prof. Damodaran also has a word of caution for investors drawn to ESG funds in the quest for higher returns while seeking to lessen the burden on their social consciousness. If the market gets carried away and overprices how much being "good" will add to a company's profitability, then investing in 'good' companies will generate lower risk-adjusted returns than investing in 'bad' companies.Prof. Damodaran’s critique is quite exhaustive and makes many valid points. In this article, I have been able to convey only a gist of what I thought were his key points. I would urge interested readers to check out his blog post of September 14, 2021, under the title “The ESG Movement: The "Goodness" Gravy Train Rolls On!” In this blog he refers to an earlier post on the same subject dated September 21, 2020, which also makes for compelling reading. This blog carries the title “Sounding good or Doing good? A Skeptical Look at ESG” and that just about sums up the entire case against carrying ESG investing too far.Published in Unique Times Magazine, October 2021(V.P.

Is Bitcoin Taking the Sheen Off Gold? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Is Bitcoin Taking the Sheen Off Gold? September 23, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share I write in continuation of my earlier article “Gold: Outlook for 2021 and the competition from crypto currencies” published in the February 2021 issue of this magazine. In that article, I had looked at how investors, uncomfortable with the surge in money printing by central banks, have fuelled a rush of money into digital cryptocurrency. The returns on gold during calendar year 2021 were far outstripped by the multi-fold rise in Bitcoin and other digital cryptocurrencies. Consequently, investors wary of the US dollar in this age of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, were shifting a part of their portfolio from gold to bitcoins. The size of the market for cryptocurrencies had reached a third of private sector gold investments in just a decade. I had concluded with the observation that had Bitcoin not emerged as an alternative, gold prices would have continued to move up to new peaks.Now, looking at subsequent developments, in FY 2020, gold prices were steadily on the ascendant and closed with substantial gains of more than 24%. However, in FY 2021, gold did touch a record of USD 2,062 per ounce on 7 August 2020 but all the gains were given up by the end of the year to close flat at USD 1,685 per ounce. This was, of course, the year that bore the brunt of the pandemic. Due to prolonged lockdowns and other containment measures, the world economy had suffered much damage. The US GDP plunged by 32.9% (annualised) in the June 2020 quarter while the full year GDP declined 3.5%, its worst year since World War II ended. Likewise, India’s GDP contracted by a record 23.9% in the June 2020 quarter while its full year GDP for FY 2021 shrank by 7.3%.Central banks respond to the pandemicResponding to the economic distress, central banks around the world stepped up monetary stimulus. The US Fed Funds rate was dropped to near zero, and from June 2020 onwards, they began a new round of quantitative easing to pump money and shore up the economy. The US Fed is currently injecting liquidity to the tune of US $ 120 billion every month by purchasing $80 billion worth of US treasury bonds and $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities (to support the real estate market). This money is all newly created money, in other words, created out of thin air.Further, to alleviate distress among ordinary people, the US government also added fiscal stimulus as part of Covid relief. By the time Joe Biden took over as President, most Americans barring the wealthy had already received two payments of $1200 and $600 per person. After the passage of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in March 2021, millions of Americans have received a further one-time direct payment of up to $1,400 each. On top of all this, the US Federal government has been providing an extra weekly payment of US$300 to all its unemployed citizens (which expires in September 2021).The US was not alone. When financial conditions began to tighten in March 2020, most central banks in the advanced economies rapidly injected liquidity through market operations and purchased government bonds to support market functioning. Other measures to support economic activity included lower policy rates, the introduction of new or expanded asset purchase programs, and schemes to lower longer-term interest rates and to support the flow of credit to businesses and households. Chart 1: Money Supply Growth in Major Advanced Economies With all this free money sloshing around, and with interest rates held at near zero levels, conventional wisdom would suggest that the price of gold should have shot through the roof. However, the reality is that after the peak of US$2,062 on 7 August 2020, gold prices ended up correcting sharply and touched a low of US$1,685 on 31 March 2021. Since then, it has gained somewhat but continues to struggle to hold levels above US$1,800.What could be the reasons or the likely factors holding down gold and preventing its rise to the levels expected of it? Many analysts would point to the strength of the recovery in the global economy and the rapid gains in the stock market as factors shifting money away from gold. While this is true for now, the fact is, investors who put money into gold are often those seeking a safe haven investment, especially at a time of valid fears about currency debasement causing a resurgence of inflation. The US Fed has printed money at a frenetic pace after the pandemic, and the run-up in inflation has already begun. In April this year, US consumer price inflation registered an increase of 4.2% over the year, with equally hefty increases in the months following. Yet, gold price has not gained as conventional wisdom would suggest.The Bitcoin FactorThat brings us to Bitcoin and the outsized gains this cryptocurrency has posted over the last one to one-and-half years. Consider the period from 7 August 2020 onwards. That was the day that gold price had hit a peak of US$ 2,062 per ounce and Bitcoin was trading at US$11,592 per digital coin. Fast forward to recent days (first week of September) when gold trades at about US$ 1,812, a decline of 12% from the peak, while Bitcoin is fetching US$ 49,999 apiece, more than 4 times the level on 7 August 2020. The below table plots the difference in price between one Bitcoin and one troy ounce of gold, and it shows how much Bitcoin has gained over gold in recent months. Chart 2: US Dollar vs. Bitcoin – Difference in US$ price between one Bitcoin and one ounce of GoldBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator which can also be transferred from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network which does not need intermediaries. Transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a block chain after they are verified by network nodes using codes (cryptography) which also ensures anonymity for the users. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.The idea behind a decentralized cryptocurrency was to eliminate centralized control of money from government agencies. An alternate currency, outside the purview of governments and government agencies, is an idea with merit and appeals to our instinct or gut feeling.By design, Bitcoin limits the maximum number of bitcoins that can be generated to 21 million. This is cited as an advantage over paper currency that can be printed at will by central banks. Besides, its design makes it especially useful for international transfers which would attract currency conversion charges otherwise, and also carry settlement and counterparty risks. Another point in favour of Bitcoin is that you don’t need a bank account to transact with Bitcoins.However, the drawbacks are also equally, if not more, substantial. Firstly, it is not backed by any physical asset and that makes it just like any fiat or paper currency. Secondly, a very important function of currency is to act as a store of value. The sheer volatility in Bitcoin prices makes it unreliable as a store of value though speculators would find it attractive. Thirdly, in its role as a currency for day-to-day transactions, it suffers from systemic limitations such as painfully slow transaction speeds. That’s because each transaction requires validation by a network of other users called “miners” who solve complex mathematical problems to verify the transactions on the network. The miners get rewarded by bitcoins based on their success in solving such problems.The below able shows the month-to-month volatility in the price of Bitcoin since 2013 which points to its unsuitability as a store of value.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator which can also be transferred from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network which does not need intermediaries.

The US has an inflation problem | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The US has an inflation problem August 24, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share The US has an inflation problemA jump in US inflation may pressure the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. How would India fare in that scenario?There is no doubt that the US economy is facing an inflation problem. And the risk is that if it is not handled with care, it can get out of hand.According to the US Labour Department, Consumer Price Index (CPI) in June 2021 increased by 5.4% from a year ago, the highest 12-month rate since August 2008. Earlier, the consumer price inflation for the month of May showed a 5% increase over the year, which was also the highest 12-month rate since August 2008. But the run-up in inflation had begun in April this year when consumer prices registered a 4.2% increase over the year. For the record, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has long targeted an inflation rate of 2%, so these numbers are clearly well above their comfort zone.Indeed, the US Fed has acknowledged that inflation is stronger and perhaps more durable than they had anticipated. When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met in June, they revised their estimated consumer inflation for the whole-year to 3.4%, which is 1 percentage point higher than their March projection, and double of what they had forecasted in June 2020. However, they insist there is no need to press the panic button as higher prices are transitory, and related to the peculiarities of an economy getting back on its feet after the unprecedented lockdowns.It can be argued that comparing today’s price levels to those prevailing a year ago is subject to the base effect given that large parts of the economy were shut down last year. While that is true, the fact remains, inflation measured on a month-on-month basis also offers no comfort. US consumer price inflation jumped 0.9% month-on-month in June after recording a 0.6% gain in May that in turn followed a 0.8% increase in April and 0.6% in March. The strong run-up of month on month (MoM) readings over the past few months makes the Fed stance of inflation being ‘transitory’ open to question, if not outright doubt.Predictably, these numbers have led to increasing calls for a faster winding down of the massive monetary stimulus the Fed has been injecting into the economy. It may be recalled that in March 2020, in response to the economic shock of the pandemic, the Fed had cut its benchmark federal funds rate sharply. The target for this rate (that banks pay to borrow from each other overnight) was brought down to near zero, to a range of 0% to 0.25%. Further, from June 2020 onwards, the Fed started buying US treasuries worth $80 billion and mortgage-backed securities worth $40 billion every month (a monthly injection of liquidity worth $120 billion) which continues to this day.The rising prices point to strong consumer demand boosted by the good progress in vaccinations, the easing of restrictions on business as the virus recedes, the trillions of dollars in federal pandemic relief, and ample household savings that have surged in recent months (after liberal handouts from the federal government). Housing and shelter prices in US continue to increase at a frantic pace, strengthening the belief that inflation could be sticky. Housing costs have an undue bearing on inflation risks as primary rents and owners’ equivalent rent account for a third of the CPI basket.The current increase in inflation has other structural causes that are not entirely related to the pandemic. Driven by all the stimulus money, the economy is growing at a fast pace, and demand is outpacing supply as the production capacity of the economy limps back to normal after the pandemic shock. Wages have risen significantly against a scenario of firms reporting acute difficulties in hiring suitable labour to operate their businesses. For instance, in May this year it was reported that more than nine million Americans wanted jobs but were unable to find them while at the same time companies reported they had more than nine million unfilled job vacancies, a record high. This explains why wages have risen even as the unemployment rate which stood at 5.9% in June continues to be above the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%. This dichotomy has come about because of overly generous unemployment benefits which have made labour choosier about the jobs they accept. However, the current series of benefits are set to expire in September 2021, and labour shortages and the pressure on wages should ease somewhat, even though wage increases are known to be sticky.The Global Financial Crisis of 2008It is a fact that US monetary policy has been on an expansionary path ever since the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008. GFC was a watershed in the economic history of the world, because of the resort to unconventional methods by the central banks of the advanced economies. The idea of quantitative easing (QE) emerged that to restore growth and employment, central banks should stimulate the economy by injecting as much money as needed and cutting interest rates sharply. At the start of the meltdown in 2008, the US Federal Reserve held assets worth about US$870 billion. By 2015, with successive rounds of QE, it had ballooned to US$ 4.5 trillion. Many predicted inflation but it did not happen. However, asset prices (stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate) did go up sharply along with equities in emerging markets including India. In 2018, the Fed decided to normalise its monetary policy and began by targeting a US$ 10 billion monthly reduction of its bond holdings that would gradually increase to US$ 50 billion. Within a year, the Fed had succeeded in bringing down its balance sheet size to US$ 3.8 trillion. But in the aftermath of the pandemic, the US Fed restarted bond buying and today its assets have shot up to over US$ 8 trillion. All of this has a direct bearing on the supply of money in the economy and gives strength to fears of inflation. Against this backdrop, the US government’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill signed into law by President Biden in March will put more money into the hands of people without necessarily adding to output.Likely consequences of higher US inflationShould higher US inflation be here to stay, what would be the international consequences? In other words, what would be the consequences if the Fed is forced to tighten monetary policy well ahead of schedule? Afterall, it would be sensible for policymakers around the world, and particularly of the vulnerable economies, to be prepared for the possibility of US interest rates rising sooner and faster than currently predicted.History tells us that if US interest rates were to rise sharply, countries with large foreign-currency debt (particularly short-term debt maturing within a year) and holding relatively low foreign-exchange reserves would become vulnerable to a currency and debt crisis. In this context, the experience of 2013 is quite relevant. That was when the US Fed made a serious attempt to raise interest rates, in what later came to be known as the “taper tantrum.” The world had come out of the global financial crisis, and the Fed decided to reduce, or taper off, the quantitative easing begun in 2008. Essentially, this meant reducing the purchases of treasury bonds and thereby the quantity of money being pumped into the economy. However, by this time investors had come to depend on Fed support for sustaining asset prices, and they responded to the prospect of decline in bond prices by hitting the sell button in panic.The result was that bond prices fell, and yields shot up. The consequences were felt all over the world as investors pulled their money back to the safety of the US dollar, leading to sharp outflows from emerging markets (including India) which forced central banks to hike interest rates. As foreign portfolio investors began to pull their money out of India, the rupee fell by over 15 percent between late-May and late-August 2013. India found an unwelcome mention on Morgan Stanley’s “fragile five” list along with Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey. The Reserve Bank of India was forced to raise interest rates to cap the outflow. However, success was limited and eventually India had to borrow about US$ 30 billion at a high cost under the FCNRB route to restore stability.How vulnerable is India today?Can something like that happen again? The chances are unlikely because as against $275 billion in forex reserves in August 2013, India’s forex reserves currently stand at over $600 billion. Hence, there is greater confidence among policymakers today that the economy can deal with a taper tantrum like situation should it arise. However, that does not rule out short-term volatility and pain.As interest rates rise in the US and other advanced economies, there will be an initial period when emerging market economies will see capital stampeding back to the US attracted by the higher interest rates. Almost certainly, there will be turbulence in the capital and currency markets with falling stock prices and the rupee shedding value. To counter the outflow, the RBI would have to raise interest rates besides drawing down on its accumulated forex reserves to support the rupee. A weakened rupee can have an inflationary impact as cost of essential imports especially petroleum goes up. Further, higher interest rates also add to overall inflation by pushing up the cost of business. The turbulence will gradually wind down once the rupee is stabilized and international investors come to realize that potential returns from investments in India outweigh what is on offer in the advanced economies.One of the bright spots for the Indian economy in the gloom of the pandemic age has been corporate India’s remarkable success in cost cutting which has led to earnings beating estimates. In recent years, India has made great strides with its Digital India campaign, having emerged as the second-fastest digital adopter among seventeen major digital economies. The digital infrastructure has added to the resilience of India’s corporate sector and it was a key enabler for cost cutting during the pandemic. Besides, start-ups in India’s tech-enabled services sector have become a magnet for foreign investors. The potential for growth here is enormous and unlikely to be missed by international investors.The other good news is that after the introduction of the GST in 2017, we appear to have overcome all the teething problems and stabilized the system. Over the last 10 months, GST collections have consistently exceeded the Rs.100,000 crore level barring collections pertaining to June 2021 which was affected by the second wave. India has now become one common market for most goods and services and that has given a boost to e-commerce. GST has also served to accelerate the formalization of the Indian economy which has helped the organized sector increase its market share and reap economies of scale. That is one reason why in the recent earnings seasons, most companies have beaten estimates and why the economy has rebounded so well, both after the first and the second waves. Moreover, India’s infrastructure has undergone major upgradation, and our roadways and railways are in much better shape now. In the coming years, major gains will accrue from this improvement by way of lower costs for business which in turn improves export competitiveness. Recently, it was announced that India had exported goods worth a record $35.2 billion in July 2021 while exports in Q1FY22 stood at a record $95 billion. Importantly, India’s merchandise exports in July 2021 represented a significant increase of 34% over what was achieved July 2019, before the pandemic.The taper tantrum of 2013 was an unhappy experience for India and one reason was that the economy was already overheated then. That was because the government had delayed rolling back the generous fiscal stimulus provided after the 2008 global crisis setting off prolonged high inflation. In contrast, in the current crisis, India has been something of an outlier in terms of its fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic which has been faulted for inadequacy. However, this may well turn out to be the right response given the storm clouds gathering ahead.Summing up, the global economy would face significant headwinds if US inflation gets out of hand.

Which type of gold ornament gives you the highest value per gram on gold loans? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Which type of gold ornament gives you the highest value per gram on gold loans? August 20, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share The gold loan has been the best way to meet financial requirements in an emergency scenario. The loan against gold business has increased manifold in recent years. The flagging business situation, due to the prevalent pandemic, has been the predominant factor in the increase of gold loans. Furthermore, the interest of gold loans has been favorable for the borrower compared to personal and business loans. People found it better to opt for gold loans instead of other more demanding finance schemes and loans. Low-interest rate of gold loan, minimal paperwork since the gold is pledged in the case of loan against gold, and quick disbursement have also been instrumental in making gold loan the preferred option. Gold loan per gram rate would differ according to the bank or NBFC you approach for the loan against gold. A noteworthy factor is that the Reserve bank of India has laid out the gold lending norms. The RBI, the Central Bank and financial regulatory body of the country, has stipulated that the maximum permissible loan to value (LTV) ratio for gold loans at 75%. It may be noted that there are many factors that decide the gold loan per gram rate. Besides this, you may confirm the interest of the gold loan before finalizing the financer. The elements that result in reduced value on loan against gold are the quality of gold, the extant regulations in the NBFC or bank providing the gold loan, and the present gold price. On the other hand, the borrower must examine the entities offering loan against gold, to choose the best one. The interest of the gold loan, the gold loan per gram rate, and other relevant aspects must be considered prior to choosing the gold loan lender. We would be elaborating the comprehensive details on loan against gold or gold loan, gold loan per gram rate, the interest of gold loan, the type of gold ornament that give the highest value per gram on gold loans, etc. How is the Valuation of the Gold Ornament Undertaken? India continues to be among the top five nations that import gold. We have been exhibiting an affinity towards gold ornaments for centuries. Besides being a precious metal that amplifies one’s beauty and dignity, a loan against gold or a gold loan is the best method for investment. It also renders a sense of financial security to the individuals. In addition to all the above, the possibility of a loan against gold makes it a sensible decision to invest in gold. Leading financial firms like Manappuram Finance offers online gold loan facility as well. Moreover, they offer diminishing balance interest in a gold loan. Such futuristic steps help individuals to obtain money at any time of the day (24x7) in case of emergency needs. The lender would examine the gold to confirm the purity and ascertain the value. The gold loan per gram rate would directly depend on the assessment by the experts at the NBFC or bank. The interest on gold loans would be according to the policies laid down by the financer. Lets’ see the factors that affect the gold loan per gram rate in detail. 1. Karat Karat is the measure that denotes the purity of gold. Any financer that provides gold loan would check the quality and purity of gold before approving the gold loan. The gold loan per gram rate on loan against gold would be based on the evaluation. Typically, the purity of gold ornaments is from 18 Karat to 22 Karat. As you can understand, the loan against gold with 22K gold would fetch you more value than 18 K gold. The interest of gold loans would not vary with respect to differences in quality. At the same time, the laid down policies of the specific financer would be the determining factor in this regard. 2. LTV The Loan to Value Rate or LTV ratio is the maximum permissible gold loan per gram rate. The NBFC or the bank can approve a loan against gold according to the LTV ratio only. The present LTV ratio for gold loans is 75%. The gold loan per gram rate would be applied on the present market price of gold, for approving the gold loan amount, irrespective of the age of the gold. Even though the lender can give up to 75%, the exact value given on a loan against gold would depend directly on the entity’s policy. 3. Current Price The gold loan amount is calculated on the current market price of gold. Therefore, the amount sanctioned on loan against gold would be lower if the price has fallen. You may get a high gold loan per gram rate than the existing values in the unorganised market, nevertheless, the interest of gold loan would be way higher than acceptable. It can result in a debt trap, in turn, you may lose your gold forever. This underscores the fact that you must approach only a reliable entity for a gold loan. Further, the interest of a gold loan would be favourable with reputed NBFCs and banks. 4. Additional Decorations The additional decorative pieces including precious stones such as diamonds would not increase the gold loan per gram rate or the approved amount on the gold loan. Yes, the extra fittings would be simply disregarded whilst calculation the gold loan per gram rate. The amount approved and interest of loan against gold would solely on the weight of gold. None of these elements affects the interest of a gold loan. Type of Gold Ornaments that Give Highest Value Per Gram You can expect a higher value, on loan against gold, when the mortgaged gold is of high quality. The type of gold ornaments that can fetch the highest value per gram on gold loan are: • Gold ornament or gold asset of 22 karats or more can get you the maximum value on a gold loan. The interest of gold loan is not related to purity, many a time. • The weight of diamonds and stones is not considered for evaluating gold loan per gram rate. Therefore, the weightage of those doesn’t matter at all. The gold without any such additional items can get you the value directly proportional to the weight. The interest of gold loan does not change in any case. • The gold ornaments or gold property of purity of 18 karats or below would have a reduced gold loan per gram rate. The total money approved on the loan against gold would be impacted if the purity of the gold is in this range. Note that, diamond-studded gold ornaments are normally designed on 18 karat gold. Hence, the gold loan per gram rate on those would not be as much as you expect. In addition, the weightage of the diamond would be deducted for calculating the gold loan amount. What are the Things to Consider Whilst Taking a Gold loan? The gold loan is the best method to resolve a financial crisis at home or business. However, you must be cautious enough to avoid a debt trap. A loan against gold must be taken according to your calculated financial capacity only. Since the interest of the gold loan is comparatively less, people tend to take a high amount pledging gold. It is not a good sign. Take only the required amount and mortgage the requisite gold after calculating the gold loan per gram rate. Online gold loan is another advisable alternative for meeting urgent fund requirements. In this case, the gold would be held in the locker of the NBFC and the borrower can apply for a loan against gold through the website or the mobile app. Do you have any queries regarding loan against gold, the interest of gold loan, gold loan per gram rate, or anything else?

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. How Manappuram become the most secure gold loan company In India? August 17, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share Manappuram Finance established an eminent position among the gold loan companies in India. Nothing less than dedicated support to the customers and client-oriented services are behind this prestigious feat. The positive factors like the lowest gold loan interest rate and the easy approval of gold loan have made it the best gold loan company. It takes concerted efforts from the team and a considerate attitude towards borrowers to come out on top given the intense competition with the best banks active in gold loans and among the gold loan companies in India. Of course, the gold loan with low interest rate can attract more clients. However, sustaining the growth and maintaining a positive outlook necessitate exemplary reliability. Only then, a financier, bank, or NBFC can become the best gold loan company. Manappuram could garner widespread publicity and acceptance to reach an admirable level among the gold loan companies. The reasons for this attainment are many, including the lowest gold loan interest rate. We would be looking into the prime elements that made Manappuram a prominent one out of all the gold loan companies. Gold Loan Parameters in Manappuram Finance Manappuram is currently offering the lowest gold loan interest rate. Further, the other gold loan parameters like gold loan amount, gold loan interest rate, gold loan processing fee, gold loan tenure, etc also have been instrumental in making it the best gold loan company. · Gold loan interest rate – From 7% to 29% (the lowest gold loan interest rate among gold loan companies in the country)· Gold loan amount disbursed by the gold loan company – Minimum ₹1,000· Gold loan tenure – 1 day to 6 months· Gold loan processing fee - ₹10 only (pay at the time of gold loan settlement) You might have understood by now that Manappuram is the best gold loan bank (NBFC) that offers a gold loan with low interest. The lowest gold loan interest rate ensures that the financial burden on the borrower is reduced remarkably. Features that Make Manappuram the Best One in Gold loan companies Serving the customers wholeheartedly, with services designed keeping their needs in the forefront, Manappuram leads the gold loan companies. We could create a strong identity as the best gold loan establishment, even though we are an NBFC, in a short time since inception. The features that attributed to our phenomenal growth as the best gold loan company are enlisted and elaborated in the succeeding paragraphs. The Lowest gold loan interest rate – Gold loan with low interest is the first point every borrower, every individual, looks for. Manappuram could offer loans against gold at the lowest gold loan interest rate. The competitors including other NBFCs, nationalized and private banks, and private financers could not come any close to us in delivering gold loan with low interest. In turn, the entity became the first choice whenever a client searched for gold loan companies. Even the best gold loan banks failed to overcome Manappuram in this aspect. Trusted Gold loan Company – It is impossible to become the best gold loan bank without the unwavering support from the customers. Trust is the mainstay for any gold loan company anywhere in the world. Hidden charges, intricate gold loan calculations, and deceptions after stating the lowest gold loan interest rate can destroy the image of a gold loan company.We have been focussing on customer-centric initiatives to retain the faith and maintain an optimistic image throughout. Our executives are trained to help the borrowers in the best possible way. We understand that every customer, who approaches us, would be in the dire need of money. Therefore, we make sure that they are attended to and offered the right service. You may not find such an honest attitude in most of the other gold loan companies or those considered as the best gold loan bank. Wide Range of Services – We have an extensive range of gold loan services for the customer to choose from. The best gold loan bank may also fall well behind us, in the case of the spectrum of facilities. Our dedicatedly derived options and facilities make the borrower comfortable and aid him or her in selecting the ideal one. In addition to presenting the debtors with a gold loan with low interest, we have several additional initiatives advantageous for the client. You may understand that it is not a cakewalk to scale the summit in the highly competitive race of gold loan companies. Online Gold Loan (OGL) Option – How convenient it is to apply for a gold loan sitting at home? The online gold loan facility from Manappuram provides a gold loan instantly. Anyone can register for OGL following some simple steps. Besides being the gold loan company with the lowest gold loan interest rate, the online gold loan has paved the way for Manappuram to become the most secure gold loan company in India. The individual can visit any branch, fill in the details, register for an online gold loan, deposit the gold in the locker, and become eligible for OGL. The best gold loan bank or the gold loan company with a different approach, we have garnered unparalleled acceptance in society. High LTV Compared to other Gold loan companies – The Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for gold loans in India had been capped at 75% earlier. Nonetheless, not all companies appraise the gold for its full value and with minimum deductions. We are proud to state that we offer the highest LTV . An increased LTV means that you can receive the required fund by pledging the minimum amount of gold. What else is needed to become the best gold loan company in India? Fixed Processing Fee – The processing fee is just an additional financial burden on the borrower. Although some amount must be charged for the clerical and administrative processing of the gold loan, it should not turn a financial burden on the borrower. Since he or she might already be in a financial crisis. With this thoughtful attitude, we have fixed the processing fee at ₹10, which needed to be paid during the settlement only. Unlike other gold loan companies that charge around 0.25% to 0.5% as processing fees. Furthermore, the debtor needs to pay it during the gold loan sanction itself. The best gold loan banks in the country also ask for processing fees without any due consideration of the financial status of the client. We have made it point, not to disturb the customer in any way. One of the key reasons that enhanced our customer base. And made us the most secured gold loan company in India. Your search ends here if you were looking for the best gold loan bank. Customer Satisfaction – Customer satisfaction has been of paramount importance for our gold loan company. We go the extra mile in making the client satisfied with our service. To make the best possible efforts, we have a team of handpicked professionals managing the gold loan formalities, advising the borrowers, and supporting the new clients. Gold loan with low interest will not fetch clients in long term, but considerately crafted services will. We stand tall among the gold loan companies in the country, with the proficient support and services we provide. The lowest gold loan interest rate is just one of the many optimistic factors that led to achievement. A Google search would reveal to you that Manappuram is the best gold loan company with 4.3 ratings. We have also received the highest number of positive reviews compared to the other gold loan companies. Pan-India Presence – Manappuram Finance has a pan-India presence, with branches in most of the major cities around the country. Most of the gold loan companies lack a wide presence. This limits their possibility of becoming the best gold loan bank. Located in the prime regions, offering the lowest gold loan interest rate, and disbursing gold loan instantly, the entity gained acceptance of the clients. Borrowers will receive money without any undue delay or hidden charges. The gold loan with low interest rate from a reputed gold loan company quickened the growth of Manappuram. How to Choose the Gold loan Company? With several gold loan companies around, each one claiming self to be the best, the customer may turn confused. All would be offering the lowest gold loan interest rate, the best service, and extensive support. Perplexed due to the heavy marketing strategy of the gold loan companies, the borrowers tend to make mistakes. They may choose the worst one thinking it to be the best gold loan bank. Determine the Reliability – You are going to deal with the gold loan company on financial matters. Their reliability and considerate attitude are of the highest importance. The best gold loan bank or NBFC will favour the client in the best possible way. Not only would they provide a gold loan with low interest but also extent optimal support. We have cemented our trustworthy identity through matchless support, surpassing the expectations of the client. This is the first point that elevated us to the top position among the gold loan companies. How Much Would You Pay Extra? – The gold loan companies might be offering a gold loan with low interest, however, with strings attached. Yes, there might be additional fees and charges, which are mentioned under the asterisk. The best gold loan financier should clearly state to you the total interest payable for the specific period. Instead of just stating the lowest gold loan interest rate. Of course, you may not have sufficient time to go through all the calculations. We suggest you register for an online gold loan (OGL) from us in that case. OGL is the best option to get a gold loan with low interest instantly. Pursue this suggestion, especially if you are a business person or in a field that may have frequent fund requirements. The lowest gold loan interest rate from our gold loan company will not cause a financial liability as well. Comfortable Repayment – Comfortable repayment options is another prominent factor that distinguishes gold loan from other loans. In addition to the fact, a gold loan with low interest rate is more advisable than a personal or business loan, the repayment choice available makes a gold loan the best one. The best gold loan banks and NBFCs would suggest to you at least four flexible repayment options. Avoid those gold loan companies that appear rigid in this regard. Our gold loan company has around four types of gold loan repayment options available for our esteemed clients. Repay the money you borrowed in any of the ways, enjoy the lowest gold loan interest rate, and live happily. Gold loan Processing Time – Several gold loan companies have strict norms regarding the approval of the gold loan. They are least bothered about the customer. They may not be offering the lowest gold loan interest rate or anything but would be adamant concerning the procedure. Such a gold loan company may not be the right choice for a gold loan. We request you to avoid those entities even if they offer gold loan with low interest. The time consumed would impede your subsequent activities. What is the use of money that is not received in time, after all? Manappuram could help numerous borrowers, who were struggling with financial requirements, by delivering them with the gold loan with low interest. How Long Have They Been in the Field? – The experience and the period of existence are very much vital to identify how consistently performing the gold loan company has been. It is a common thing for any new entity to promulgate customer-oriented policies and special deals during the initial stage of operation. It does not mean that they offer the best gold loan. The deals, discounts, and exclusive features are the strategies to get more clients. That’s it. The lowest gold loan interest rate is the most common tact to get more borrowers on board. This is another key area where Manappuram Finance has been outperforming the gold loan offered by banks and other gold loan companies. We have been presenting the clients with the most promising offers and deals for decades since inception. Gold loan with low interest is not the only thing we offer. The lowest gold loan interest rate is one of the many benefits the customers get when they choose our gold loan company. Having been a persistently performing gold loan company, or you can call it the best gold loan bank, Manappuram has a proven record of accomplishment. Safety of the Gold Pledged – Your gold would be stored in the lockers of the gold loan company. What if it gets stolen? Who will repay you? Are you going to be the sufferer for no mistake of yours!?

In this case, the principal amount can be paid when the gold loan matures. The financial burden on the borrower would be reduced significantly when he or she selects this repayment method. Moreover, the debtor would be able to accumulate enough money, by the time the maturity date arrives. 3. Partial Payment Option Perhaps, this repayment option is only possible in a loan against gold making the gold loan from a reputed finance firm a better choice. Under the partial payment option, the client can go for partial repayment of the principal amount and accrued interest as per one’s convenience. By repaying the major share of the principal amount, the interest accruing further would come down significantly. This repayment methodology is ideal for self-employed individuals, businesspersons, etc. Since the interest rate on the gold loan is calculated on a daily basis the partial repayment of the principal amount will have a positive impact and bring down the subsequent repayment burden. Discuss with the financier to confirm the process followed by them. It may also be possible to switch from one repayment option to another midway through the repayment cycle. This helps in opting for another repayment methodology if your financial condition is not going as calculated. 4. Single Repayment Scheme Single repayment or basic bullet repayment is another repayment option available on gold loans. As per this, the debtor can opt to pay the complete amount (i.e., interest rate on gold + principal amount) on maturity. Those engaged in business or those expecting the receipt of a lump sum amount can choose this gold loan repayment option. On the other hand, this type of repayment is not advisable for long-term loans against gold. Individuals considering a gold loan for up to 12 months can consider this scheme. Otherwise, it may turn burdensome for the borrower. The long period will lead to compounding interest piling up and the outstanding loan amount will become burdensome, beyond the financial capacity of the individual. It may also happen that the financier may auction the gold if the borrower fails to repay the loan amount for a prolonged time. Increase in Popularity of Gold loans for the Past Couple of Years Several factors have been instrumental in the increase in popularity of gold loans in the recent past. The drop in the interest rate on gold loans, convenient processing, quick approval, and the hassle-free procedure have been the basic factors that led to more people opting for gold loans. Entrepreneurs, self-employed personnel, private employees, laborers, and others have been facing acute financial distress in the past couple of years, mainly due to the unforeseen pandemic. The increased financial requirements resulted in individuals turning to gold loans. We are happy to be one of the top NBFCs in India that serves hundreds of thousands of customers.

A suggestion for RBI’s Regulations Review Authority | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. A suggestion for RBI’s Regulations Review Authority July 29, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. Nandakumar To promote the next level of financial inclusion, let us remove restrictions on opening new branches that currently apply to gold loan NBFCs Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set up of a Regulations Review Authority (RRA 2.0) to review its regulations internally, and in consultation with other stakeholders. The RRA will focus on streamlining regulatory instructions and reducing the compliance burden of regulated entities by simplifying procedures and reducing reporting requirements. Accordingly, the RBI invited leading industry bodies such as CII, FICCI and ASSOCHAM to offer their suggestions following which these bodies called upon their members to list out such issues. At Manappuram, we responded by pointing to a long-standing concern, the fact that gold loan focused NBFCs with more than 1,000 branches still require prior approval from the RBI before opening a new branch anywhere. The rule came into force sometime in FY 2012-13, a time when there was real concern among policymakers about rising gold imports and the widening current account deficit (CAD). The feeling then was that gold loan NBFCs were somehow contributing to the import surge. That impression was later dispelled by the RBI itself when the working group it had appointed to study all these issues related to gold and gold loans (the K.U.B. Rao committee) submitted its report in 2013. The Rao Committee report categorically stated that “there is also a need to increase monetization of idle gold stocks in the economy for productive purposes. Encouraging loans against the collateral of gold for productive purposes may be a way to do this.” It observed that the financial performance of the gold loans NBFCs and their borrowings from the banking system have no immediate systemic implications for domestic financial stability arising from the interconnectedness of gold loans NBFCs and the banking system. However, the requirement to obtain prior approval from RBI before opening new branches continues to be in force to this day. What’s even more surprising is that there are 9,000+ NBFCs in India regulated by RBI, but this restriction applies only to three gold loan focused NBFCs, viz. Manappuram Finance, Muthoot Finance and Muthoot Fincorp. That’s because there are only three gold loan focused NBFCs that have more than 1,000 branches. It is well-known that India’s economic growth is constrained by the capital crunch faced by its financial system which impairs its ability to provide much-needed credit for economic activities. On the other hand, the leading gold loan NBFCs don’t face a capital crunch but they must reckon with artificial restrictions when they step up to address the yawning gap in the supply of credit. That leaves vulnerable sections of society at the mercy of moneylenders and pawnbrokers. Anyone familiar with the gold loan business would know that gold loan NBFCs cater mostly to the marginalised sections who lack access to banks, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. More than two-thirds of the gold loans given by NBFCs are microloans by nature, averaging amounts of less than Rs.50,000. And when you have a time-consuming process of prior approval for each new branch we wish to open, it becomes a bottleneck to the flow of credit to the unbanked sections of society. They are left with no alternatives but to continue to depend on the unorganised sector whose loans come with high interest rates and adverse terms. On the other hand, institutional gold loan providers (banks and NBFCs) are regulated by the RBI and provide a fairer and more transparent loan against gold jewellery, thereby drawing customers away from non-institutional lenders operating without regulatory oversight. But then, banks face the challenge of limited reach. Also, with multiple products vying for attention, small ticket gold loans of short tenures hold little attraction for them. Gold loan NBFCs face no such constraints and thanks to their low operating costs, are well placed for last mile delivery of credit. They have won recognition as pioneers who have professionalized this traditional activity and introduced transparency, technology, and scale to the business. They were instrumental in reducing the dominance of the unorganized players in gold loan and thus paving the way for the rest of the banking sector to follow. Over the years, we have seen anecdotal evidence that whenever gold loan NBFCs open a new branch in a semi-urban or rural location (where other banks and NBFCs are not present), the mere entry into the market causes a drop in the interest rates that moneylenders of the locality charge. What happens is that once an organised sector gold loan lender enters a new territory, it begins to pose stiff competition to the moneylenders and pawnbrokers of the area who ruled the roost till then. Therefore, an unintended consequence of policies that curtail branch expansion by gold loans NBFCs is that it effectively strengthens the hands of the unregulated local financiers at the cost of marginal borrowers. Gold loan NBFCs deserve encouragement from the policymakers to lead the way for institutional lenders to gain market share from the unorganised moneylenders who control two-thirds of the gold loan market even today. Gold loan NBFCs have a unique business model, funding small and marginal borrowers, who would otherwise end up borrowing from moneylenders and loan sharks. These borrowers would rarely have a regular source of income or possess documentary evidence to prove creditworthiness. Unlikely to have a valid credit score, they face difficulties in getting loans from banks and other NBFCs. Gold loan NBFCs not only create a credit culture among the marginal borrowers but also establish a credit history, enabling them to move up the ladder and gain access to banks and other NBFCs in due course. Accordingly, the RBI’s Regulations Review Authority should seriously consider recommending an easing of the restrictions on opening new branches by gold loan NBFCs to promote financial inclusion in every nook and corner of the country.

Best Ways You Can Repay Your Gold Loan | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Best Ways You Can Repay Your Gold Loan July 08, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share Gold loan is the most preferable loan when one is in urgent need of funds. India has registered a quantum leap in the number of gold loan borrowers in recent years. The convenient loan application process, very easy documentation process, and feasible repayment options, including gold loan repayment online make a loan against gold the most advisable one.Most of the individuals in the country purchase gold ornaments as an asset, rather than just decorative pieces. One can approach banks, NBFCs, or private individuals for gold loans. NBFCs normally offer convenient gold loan repayment methodologies including online gold loan repayment.Gold Loan Repayment OptionsYou can choose from different options to repay your gold loan. Utilize gold loan payment online if you are unable to travel to the financial firm. Let’s see the different loan repayment alternatives.1. Flexible Repayment OptionsMost of the loan repayment would be based on EMIs. Defaulters, who fail to pay the amount on the stipulated date, will have to pay a penalty. Gold repayment is flexible in nature. It doesn’t ask for any monthly payments. The borrower can repay the loan as and when he or she has enough money. Partial gold loan repayment is also possible, which is not a common aspect when you think of loans.2. Monthly PaymentAre you an employee receiving a monthly payment? Is it difficult for you to comply with the gold loan repayment altogether? Not to worry at all. Some gold loan financiers also offer EMI-based loan repayment. The monthly deduction would comprise both principal and interest amounts. Therefore, the gold loan amount would be diminishing accordingly. Government and private employees select this loan repayment method generally.3. Partial Payment of the Gold Loan EMIBorrowers can ask the NBFC for an arrangement to repay the interest accumulated on a monthly basis. The EMI hence would be less than normal EMI. The individual can pay the principal amount on completion of the gold loan tenure. One can collect the money over a period and pay the pending principal amount on the date of maturity. Check with the trustworthy NBFC or bank regarding this type of loan repayment method. This methodology is ideally chosen by most of the gold loan borrowers. Gold loan online payment is also permissible for this option.4. Payment of Total Amount TogetherThis type of gold loan repayment option is advisable for entrepreneurs but not for the salaried class. Although salaried individuals also go for this type of payment, it is suited for businesspersons normally. The total amount, including principal and interest, can be paid together at the end of the loan period. Those who can afford to pay the larger amount that accumulates by the end of the loan period, can choose this option.The gold loan has been a viable option for those in need of urgent funds. The simple process that doesn’t ask for lengthy documentation is the best choice. Unlike other loans including personal loans and business loans, where the loans are approved for specific purposes, the gold loan can be obtained irrespective of the purpose. The NBFC or bank approving the gold loan will not enquire about the requirement at all.Go only to a reputed finance firm, bank, or NBFC for a gold loan. The interest rate will not be exorbitant in reliable firms. Further, they would be supportive of your needs and requirements.

Secured Loans vs Unsecured Loans | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Secured Loans vs Unsecured Loans July 04, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share No one ever knows when an urgent requirement of money can arise. Banks and NBFCs are the support system to fall back upon when one is in dire need of funds. Such finance firms offer two types of loans for the borrowers, viz. secured loan and unsecured loan. We would be looking at what is a secured loan and what is an unsecured one. To state in simple terms, a gold loan is a secured loan. You might have got an idea of what a secured loan means. We would be discussing in detail what is a secured loan and what is an unsecured loan, with examples, in this article.What is a Secured Loan? A secured loan is the type of loan that requires the borrower to mortgage an asset against the loan. The collateral would be considered as the guarantee for the money lent. Since the banks and NBFCs receive the property, the procedure for this type of loan would be simpler than an unsecured loan. As we have seen gold loan is a secured loan, which could be obtained without any daunting process. The financers would not be examining the credit score or credit history for a secured loan. Additionally, this doesn’t necessitate a guarantor. The money is also disbursed within a short time itself. Types of Secured Loans Different types of secured loans are available. One can seek the loan depending on the availability of collateral or for specific purposes. 1. Gold Loan A gold loan is the easiest loan to get. It doesn’t require the borrower to prove his or her income details, credit score, credit history or the purpose for the loan. A guarantor is also not required in this case. Individuals can pledge their gold ornament, coin, or bar at the banks or NBFCs and receive money depending on the value of the gold asset. It will be approved within a couple of hours. We also facilitate online gold loan applications and 13 gold loan schemes for clients to choose from. The easy and convenient repayment option is another factor that amplified the acceptability of gold loans. A gold loan is a secured loan that has registered a quantum leap in the previous couple of years. 2. Vehicle Loans Vehicle loans are taken for the purchase of two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The vehicle would be the collateral in this case. The financer can sell the vehicle if the borrower defaults the repayment even after repeated reminders. The RC book would be marked “Hypothecated to…”. The hypothecation can be removed after complete repayment, on obtaining a NOC from the lender. 3. Home Loans Home loans are meant for the purchase or construction of the house. The financer/ bank would approve a maximum of 75 to 80% of the cost. The house documents, including the title deed, would remain mortgaged at the bank until all the EMIs are paid. A home loan is specifically for the purchase or construction of the house and it cannot be used for any other purpose. 4. Loan Against Property A person can mortgage his or her residential or commercial property and obtain funds. The documents would remain with the lender until the time the loan is repaid completely. 5. Secured Business Loan Businesspersons usually opt for secured business loans. The asset including machinery and industrial equipment would be mortgaged for a secured business loan. This way they would be finding funds for urgent requirements.What is Unsecured Loan? An unsecured loan doesn’t require the borrower to pledge any property, movable or immovable asset. This is the basic difference between secured and unsecured loans. The unsecured loan would be approved solely depending on the borrower’s capability to repay the loan. Financers would examine the credit history, credit score, and income status and ascertain whether she or he would be able to meet the repayment criteria. A low or poor credit score/ CIBIL score can lead to the rejection of an unsecured loan application. Unsecured loan, being a loan without any collateral, has a high-interest rate normally. This is another major difference between a secured and unsecured loan. Non-repayment or repeated defaults can affect the credit score. Types of Unsecured Loans Individuals can opt for different types of unsecured loans depending on their varying needs. The different types of unsecured loans are elaborated in the succeeding paragraphs. 1. Credit Card Loans Credit cards are normally used for the purchase of items at shopping centers and online. The debt thus created has to be repaid in the stipulated time after the generation of the bill. Credit cards can also be used for obtaining money on loans. Credit card loans incur high interest and hence are a least opted one. 2. Payday Loan This might be the least popular unsecured loan. Individuals can seek payday loan to meet instant money requirements. The money lent has to be paid by the next pay day (that’s why the name payday loan). Interest rate for the loan is phenomenally high. One should not consider this loan if there is any other way to find funds. 3. Education Loan Education loan is specifically provided for students for pursuing different courses. The fact is, banks do not promote this loan due to varying reason. The procedure for education loan is also not an easy one. 4. Personal Loan Personal loans can be availed for a variety of purposes. The lenders would scrutinize the borrower’s reliability thoroughly. Credit history, CIBIL score, and the individual’s monthly income would be the determinant factors for approval, as well as, the amount approved. Eligibility Criteria Eligibility criteria for both secured and unsecured loans are different. It would also depend on the financers. Each finance firm would like to keep the risk minimal. Hence, they formulate the loan sanction process accordingly. Eligibility Criteria for Secured Loans The criteria and prerequisites are not strict as in the case of an unsecured loan. The following conditions must be met for approval of the secured loan. · The applicant must be of 18 years or older for applying for a secured loan· Value of the asset, including gold, property, and house, would be considered for the loan amount approved· The purpose doesn’t matter in case of secured loans like a gold loan· Some banks and NBFCs approve secured loans to individuals with a stipulated monthly income only· Credit history and credit score is not checked for secured loans like gold loan Eligibility Criteria for Unsecured Loans Eligibility criteria are different for secured and unsecured loans. The regulations and criteria are more stringent in the case of an unsecured loan. The elevated risk factors are the main reason that forced financers to observe a more complex process. Since there is no security with the financers, they have to ensure that the individual would be prompt in repayment. · The applicant’s age is the first eligibility criteria to be met. The borrower must be aged between 21 and 65 years. Any person above or below this age cannot apply for an unsecured loan· A constant monthly income is mandatory. The monthly income would be an essential factor in deciding the maximum permissible loan amount· A self-employed person or an entrepreneur should have been in business for at least 05 years· A good credit score (a score above 700) is necessary for the banks to decide in favor of the applicant. A low or poor score may lead to rejection of the unsecured loan application· Credit history also plays a pivotal role in unsecured loan Documents Required Documents required for a secured loan and unsecured loan differ. A secured loan doesn’t require much documentation generally. The paperwork is a bit more in the case of an unsecured loan. In turn, people have been reluctant to go for unsecured loans. Many a time, it is better to consider a secured loan than an unsecured loan. Documents Required for Secured Loan The documents required for the secured loan would depend on the type of secured loan you choose. Secured loans like gold loan don’t require many documents. If you are approaching us for a gold loan, only identity proof and address proof and the gold to be pledged are required for loan processing. · Identity Proof – Voter’s ID, driving license, Aadhaar card, PAN card, or Ration card· Address Proof – Ration card, attested bank passbook, electricity bill, phone bill, rental agreement, or bank account statement· Salary Proof – Salary slip, a bank statement indicating salary and Form 16· Proof of age – Voter’s ID, driving license, passport or birth certificate· Original documents of the collaterals· Audited business statement Documents Required for an Unsecured Loan The documentation part of unsecured loan may turn into a herculean task. Although the documents required are similar to a secured loan, compiling those and processing the complete file would consume several days. · Identity Proof – Voter’s ID, driving license, Aadhaar card, PAN card, or Ration card· Address Proof – Ration card, attested bank passbook, electricity bill, phone bill, rental agreement, or bank account statement· Salary Proof – Salary slip, a bank statement indicating salary and Form 16· Proof of age – Voter’s ID, driving license, passport or birth certificate· Original documents of the collaterals· Audited business statement Benefits of Secured Loans Secured loans are more beneficial than unsecured loans many a time. That has been the reason for secured loan applicants in a previous couple of years. Reliable financers like Manappuram offer exceptional service to the customers that will help them in pursuing the loan process without any difficulty. Let’s look into the benefits of secured loans. · Credit score of the applicant doesn’t affect the loan approval. The NBFCs and banks are not much concerned about the credit history or CIBIL score of the borrower as they would be receiving collaterals in lieu of the money disbursed· Easy processing is the other benefit of a secured loan· The secured loans have a lower interest rate compared to most of the unsecured loans. Especially, the loans like personal loans, credit card loans, payday loans, etc have an exorbitant interest rate· Flexible repayment is another advantage on loans like a gold loan. The borrower can choose the most convenient repayment method· The income of the individual doesn’t have much importance per se. In turn, a lower income will not have any implication on the approval of a secured loan· Loans like home loans will provide tax rebates to the borrower· Online application is available for secured loans, in some reputed NBFCs like ours Benefits of Unsecured Loans Unsecured loans also possess some benefits. Those are: · The borrower doesn’t have to pledge anything for the loan. Therefore, he or she will not be losing the asset in case of default in repayment. This, in turn, enhances the confidence of the individual/ borrower· The higher the income, the higher the loan amount. The borrowing capacity depends on the financial strength and monthly income of the individual. Therefore, a person with a remarkable salary can obtain a better loan amount. On the other hand, the secured loan depends on the value of the property mortgaged· Credit score is a significant factor here. You can process the unsecured loan without any hassle if your credit score is high. Moreover, the loan sanctioning process would be fast Manappuram Finance – Your Trusted Finance Support We, at Manappuram Finance, consider our valued customers as our assets.

Neither the financial status of the individual would be sought. Features of Gold Loan The gold loan has several features that distinguish it from other loans. In fact, the beneficial features offered by gold loans make it the most useful loan. Quick Approval – Instant loan approval is the main feature of a gold loan. Borrowers don’t have to wait expecting approval from the higher-ups in the bank or NBFC in the case of a gold loan. It would be approved and money handed over after confirming the identification details of the individual, examining the application, and analyzing the purity of the gold. Easy or No Documentation – You cannot say that there is no documentation for gold loan at all. Individuals applying for a gold loan have to fill an application, attach the ID and address proof, and submit. That’s it. The lender would verify the details and notify the borrower of the amount receivable for the particular quantity of gold. Once the client agrees to the same, the money would be issued without any further delays. Secured Loan – Imagine the complexities involved when you approach a bank or NBFC for a personal loan or business loan. The main factor that would decide the eligibility of an individual is a credit score or CIBIL score. The lender would scrutinize the credit history to ascertain whether the individual is trustworthy or not. Although the past conditions cannot determine one’s present status, the finance firms will consider credit score as the benchmark. A gold loan is a secured loan, in which you would be pledging gold. Hence, the lender need not check the credit history or CIBIL score of the borrower. This feature of the gold loan helps an individual to approach firms without any concern. Gold Loan for Any Purpose – Gold loan lenders will not ask the purpose of the finance. Most of the other loans need the individual to furnish the requirements. Moreover, those loans would be admissible for specific purposes only. A gold loan can be obtained for buying vehicles, renovating home, children’s schooling, finance needs for marriage, and so on. Repayment Options – A vital feature of a gold loan is that the borrower can choose how to repay it. In the case of most of the other loans, the lender would decide the repayment process and EMIs. That is not the case here. NBFCs like ours, Manappuram Finance, offer four types of repayment options. The customer can choose the methodology and simply go ahead with it. This feature of gold loans helps individuals to plan the family budget accordingly. Furthermore, we have set up an online repayment feature as well. Procedure to Avail Gold Loan One can pursue the procedure for availing of the gold loan without any confusion. A straightforward process doesn’t require any in-depth knowledge. The debtor has to carry the gold to be mortgaged and identity/ address proof. Documents required for a gold loan are: · Identity Proof –Aadhaar card, voter’s ID, driving license, PAN card, or ration card could be used as the identity proof.· Address Proof – Electricity bill, telephone bill, ration card, rental agreement, attested bank passbook, or property document could be used as address proof. The procedure for a gold loan is: · Reach the NDFC or bank· Fill-in the application form· Submit filled application along with the identity and address proof· The financier will peruse the documents and evaluate the value of the gold. S/he will confirm the money that can is authorized for the gold you are pledging· Based on the agreement from your end, the lender will complete the other formalities including finalizing the gold loan term and pass the money. Types of Loan and Applicable Interest Individuals can opt from a plethora of loan options. Each of the loan processing procedures would be different. In addition, some of the loans are approved only for stipulated purposes. Gold Loan – Gold loan is a secured loan that could be sought irrespective of the type of requirement. We offer gold loans at remarkably low-interest rates. Further, the value for gold is significantly higher than banks and other NBFCs. Personal Loan – Personal loan is another loan option available. The personal loan interest rates are high compared to a gold loan. The loan approval procedure is also daunting. The finance firms would check the individual’s credit score and credit history before approving the loan. There are fewer chances if the CIBIL score is medium to poor. The personal loan interest rate varies from 14% to 24%. Property Loan – Borrowers can mortgage property and obtain loans against them. This is normally considered for obtaining a higher amount. The loan interest rate for property loans may go up to 12%. There are loans for specific purposes like a car loan, home loan, and education loan etcetera also available. Pros of Gold Loan Pros of the gold loan include the following. The advantages offered are the reason for the rising number of borrowers applying for gold loans across India. · Quick processing and issue of money· Minimal documentation· Easy repayment options· Facility for online gold loan application (Only at reliable NBFCs like Manappuram)· Credit score/ CIBIL score is not required· Nil processing fee· Income of the borrower is not examined· It can be for any purpose· Lower interest rate than loans like a personal loan and business loan Cons of Gold Loan The gold loan has a couple of drawbacks as well though it does not reduce the appeal of a gold loan. Loan to Value (LTV) – The Loan to Value ratio of gold loan is comparatively low. The value decided would depend on the financing firms. Nonetheless, the Reserve Bank of India has stipulations for controlling the LTV. We are happy to state that Manappuram offers the best value for the gold pledged. Loan Amount is directly related to the value of Gold pledged– Fluctuations across the world market directly affect gold prices. Consequently, the gold prices are varying in nature. The loan amount approved will not only depend on the purity of gold but also the gold price prevailing on that day. You may Lose your prized Gold Ornaments – We Indians have an emotional attachment towards gold. Many receive gold from their ancestors, making it a priced asset. More than the value of the gold ornament, the emotional value attached to it is a prime factor. Failure to repay the loan after the notice period can lead to loss of the gold assets. The finance firms are authorized to auction the gold in that case. Impact of Gold Price Fluctuation Gold price fluctuation can directly influence the gold loan rates. You may check the status of gold prices while applying for a gold loan. Nonetheless, the gold once pledged will remain with the lender until you retrieve it after complete payment. The gold price will not affect the gold already mortgaged. The effect of gold price fluctuation on gold loans are: LTV may get impacted – Loan to value ratio is determined based on the constant gold price. A frequent fluctuation of the gold prices will lead to frequently changing LTV. The creditors may decide to play safe and fix the value at a low rate. Therefore, the borrowers will be getting a comparatively low price during such times. A High Price When You are Applying – As we have said initially, the gold price whilst purchase will not be considered while approving the gold loan. The current gold price will be used for deciding the value of the asset. The purity of the gold is the only thing that matters. The gold would be checked for purity and the value would be determined. Hence, even if you bought at a low price, you can get a high value. Gold Price is Low When You are Applying – Even if you have purchased the gold when the price was high, if you pledge gold when the price is low, you will get a loan based on the lower price only. Common Mistakes Made at The Time Of Applying For Gold Loan Borrowers do make some common mistakes whilst applying for a gold loan. They may not realize the mistake until the time of repayment. In turn, the debtors would be paying the exorbitant amounts as interest, in addition to other complexities. Let’s see some of the common mistakes done by lenders at the time of applying for gold loans. Purity of the Gold Ornament – The purity of the gold is the only thing that affects the gold loan amount approved. This point may be borne in mind whilst purchasing gold ornament as well. People purchase jewelry studded with gems and precious stones. You may note that only the weight of gold would be used for the purpose of a gold loan. The weightage of stones, however precious those maybe, would be deducted. Be aware of this fact before you approach a creditor for a loan. Reliability of the NBFC/ Bank/ Vendor – You will be receiving a value determined against the gold you are pledging. The gold rates are going up day by day. Even if not so, the money you get would be less than the cost of the asset. This means that the lender can acquire a good profit whenever it is sold. You must make sure that the firm is trustworthy and they would be fully transparent in their dealings. They should not indulge in malpractices such as selling your gold without your approval, or replace it with low-quality gold. LTV Calculation – The Loan to Value (LTV) ratio would be different at different finance firms. You may confirm the LTV when applying for the gold loan. Financiers like Manappuram are known for higher LTV (depending on the scheme selected), which ensures that the borrower is receiving a high value for their gold asset. Comparison of Different Financers – The ease of obtaining a gold loan, LTV ratio, repayment options, and other criteria will exclusively depend on the lender. One must compare the NBFCs or banks offering gold loans in advance. Apply for a gold loan only at the right financier. It would make not only the loan process convenient but also would help in a stress-free repayment. Manappuram Finance – The Most Suitable Firm for Gold Loans Manappuram has always been customer-centric in nature. We have been facilitating gold loans at the best interest rate without any complex documentation process. Furthermore, we have 13 gold loan schemes for you to choose from.

Digital Learning: How the Pandemic Became a Catalyst for Change | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Digital Learning: How the Pandemic Became a Catalyst for Change June 25, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarCompanies engaged in the services sector depend a lot on their frontline employees. After all, they deal directly with customers and the image of the company depends entirely on the quality of their interaction with customers. As a leading player in the financial services business, this applies to Manappuram Finance too. And that is why we strongly believe in providing ample training and learning opportunities to our employees. Some time ago, in this magazine’s November 2020 issue, I had written at length about how digital learning had taken off at Manappuram in the aftermath of the pandemic-induced lockdowns (refer the article titled “The new normal at Manappuram”).As a matter of fact, we had embarked on the digitalisation drive well before the first wave of Covid-19 last year. However, what changed is that after the onset of the pandemic, the speed at which we adopted these transformative changes became almost breath-taking. Within a few days of the lockdown announcement, we succeeded in extending work from home facilities to all our employees. It was a herculean task to remotely connect our 22,000 employees as two-thirds hail from remote locations all over the country. It was, therefore, necessary to provide all required facilities to our employees to enable them to work remotely, and we did this on a war-footing. It could be done only because of all the investments in technology that we have been making over the previous four to five years.For example, we have been active in the digitalization of our learning and development endeavours, and we had made a good start by implementing a Learning Management System (LMS) in the year 2017. That gave us an early impetus and took us to a point where we were more than ready to embrace the transformative changes happening in the learning and development (L&D) sector today. LMS was the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way our employees were trained. We acquired the ability to make available to our employees the various modules of learning in the form of split micro segments, on a 24X7 basis. It was an achievement to train our employees virtually, without resort to any of the conventional modalities hitherto prevalent in the sector.By the middle of 2020, we had conceptualised a broader canvas of an ideal digital learning platform that finally came into being with the ideas and efforts of a team of dedicated employees at the Manappuram School of Training. And that was how, in the 21st year of the 21st century, we have now erected another milestone in our history with the implementation of our own in-house Learning Experience Platform called MADU.The term MADU has a philosophical significance to it. In ancient India it was customary for children to take their first step into the realm of knowledge by tasting a drop of honey that symbolized the fruit of knowledge. ‘Madu’ is the word for honey, and we hope MADU will uplift the learner into the higher dimensions of learning and encourage them to explore the intricacies of the subject and taste the sweet nectar of knowledge. With this platform, we aim to evolve a learning strategy focused on increasing knowledge retention and providing an intuitive user experience.As a highly customizable and interactive platform, there is potential for MADU to be further extended to the subsidiaries and group companies of Manappuram. The possibility of adoption by other companies, not necessarily part of the Manappuram stable, is also real. Importantly, I believe this will create a profound impact on Manappuram’s employees as they acquire access to a platform that enables continuous learning and self-improvement, much needed in a period of uncertainty such as today.In life, no matter how difficult the situation we find ourselves in, we should always retain our presence of mind and try to think of a solution to get things done within the constraints, rather than bemoaning over fate. Challenges pave the way for opportunities. Those who are exposed to challenges tend to utilize the best of opportunities. Look at Japan… look at Israel. The people in these regions are always exposed to challenges. They are always alert and innovative. Those countries flattened by the World Wars have made incredible progress since then. Certainly, situations like a pandemic, a war, or other such threats, cause a lot of pain but they also create opportunities. The pandemic, in this sense, acted as a catalyst for the faster adoption of digitalization and virtualization process that made us more resilient during a period of challenge and widespread adversity.With the use of this digital learning tool, we could successfully revitalize our human resources by training and upgrading their skills and making these resources available to them 24X7. We combined technology and information resources to allow remote access to educational content, breaking down the physical barriers and presenting our employees with an ‘out-of-the-box learning experience’.We have created a Digital Library combining the concepts of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. The Digital Library comprises a wide selection of books and study material, online video tutorials and interactive sessions. This leads to the concept of ‘Think & Learn’ which enhances the cognitive skills of employees.With the debut of MADU, the Manappuram Group has begun a journey that will be transformational, and I strongly believe that we shall become a pacesetter in technology enabled education, and in creating a virtual infrastructure to conduct our operations remotely.MADU, as a fount of knowledge, has already begun to create waves in the L&D sector. It has been recognised with a Certificate of Functional Competency by IIM Indore who carried out a comprehensive scrutiny of its functionalities. MADU has also become the world’s first platform to publish the digital version of a novel by Johan Brown. Over the coming days, this cutting-edge learning solution will continue to improve its usability and keep adding to the depth and breadth of its content. For now, I am happy to announce that with its 1,000+ intuitive features, MADU stands head and shoulders above any other digital learning solutions available in the industry today.

How to increase credit score in India? 10 ways to improve your CIBIL score | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. How to increase credit score in India? 10 ways to improve your CIBIL score June 10, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share Your CIBIL score is a big concern if you are planning to get a loan. It is the yardstick to identify the credibility of a borrower. Banks and financial institutions check the applicant’s CIBIL score before approving a loan. You are at the right place if you are looking for tips on how to boost your credit score immediately. This article is intended to give a few methods for increasing the score to 800 and above.At the same time, it would be ideal to consistently maintain it above the fair mark rather than becoming anxious about it at the last moment. No, you don’t have to worry even if your CIBIL score is low. It can be improved by using some simple tips and actions. In this article, we look at ways to increase your credit score quickly.What are the Factors Affecting CIBIL Score?TransUnion Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) is an approved financial institution for ascertaining credit scores since 2000. The organization evaluates the CIBIL score based on certain financial parameters. The score is considered the most reliable information to gauge the creditworthiness of an individual. It is a three-digit number ranging from 300 to 900.A credit score from 300 to 549 would be considered a Poor rating. The banks and NBFCs may not be keen on approving a loan in case you fall in this range. The score from 550 to 700 is Fair and from 701 to 900 is Good. You must focus on gaining a score above 800. The higher the score, the easier it is to obtain a loan. To be precise, banks will be eager to provide loans to those who have a CIBIL score of around 900. That’s why many engaged in business who may need loans frequently, search for ways to boost credit score to 800 or above and act accordingly.Once you have identified the aspects that play a major and decisive role in CIBIL, it would be a challenge to abide by each. Responsible financial firms would advise clients on the status of the CIBIL score and provide guidance regarding the methods to improve it. They would also have professionals to support the customers. The factors considered for determining credit score are:- The payment history of the individual- Total number of loan accounts against the debtor- Whether the person is a guarantor for any other individual (and whether the individual has defaulted payments)- Outstanding loans- Repayment history of previous loans- How prompt you were in repayment of the previous loansHow to Increase Credit Score Fast?Disciplined expenditure, timely payment of credit card bills, automatic repayment of EMIs, appropriate financial management, preventive methods to preclude budget overheads, and similar actions can be helpful in maintaining a positive CIBIL score, i.e. a credit score above 800. Nonetheless, it may not be an easy task to monitor all these, and remain perfect, when you are too busy to think and plan. Consequently, the score may go down and the agency may rate you Poor, in the CIBIL score.The steps on how to boost credit score immediately, explained here, would be of immense use. Try to apply those and elevate the score to get a loan approved without much hassle.1. Analysis of Credit Card ReportCredit cardholders face the biggest challenge concerning CIBIL scores. Any lacunae in the past delayed payments, non-repayments will be reflected in the report, impacting the credit score. The first thing a credit cardholder, hoping to increase credit score fast, must do is to analyze the credit card report. Confirm that it doesn’t have any incorrect information about your previous payments. Many times it can happen that you have paid the amount; however, it is not reflected in your account. Approach the bank and correct the anomaly in time. Furthermore, repay the pending loans or debts, if any.2. Try to Increase Credit Card LimitYou may be owning a credit card with a lower credit limit than your actual eligibility. Request the bank and raise the credit card limit (However, you should maintain the previous expenditure only). This would decrease your credit utilization remarkably. Putting you in a positive spot, as a person with controlled expenses. Once you register a decent period with this “controlled” spending, it would result in a positive CIBIL score. The lower expense vis-à-vis higher credit card limit is a positive indicator.3. Gold Loan Instead of Personal LoanGetting a gold loan instead of a personal loan, when you are in urgent need of money, will be beneficial to maintain a positive CIBIL score. Undoubtedly, it is one of the ideal options to increase the credit score as well. The main difference between a gold loan and a personal loan is that a gold loan is a secured loan and the personal loan is an unsecured one. Since the gold loan is disbursed against gold pledged at the NBFC or bank, the lender has surety concerning the money. It also has the advantage of a lower interest rate than a personal loan. Therefore, obtaining a gold loan is better from the point of improving credit scores, besides reducing the financial burden on the individual.4. Pre-payment of Gold LoanYou may be wondering about the repetition of points related to the gold loan, whilst we are discussing how to increase credit score fast. It is to enlighten those looking for some quick loan options, without hampering CIBIL score. You can arrange the required money in the shortest possible time. And do undertake early repayment of the gold loan as well. Many reputed financial firms don’t levy a charge on the pre-payment. Hence, you can close the gold loan account at the first available opportunity, enhancing your CIBIL score. However, you need to confirm whether the finance firm is charging any pre-payment fine or not. Otherwise, you will end up paying an extra amount over the usual.5. Opt for Longer Loan TenureThis point must be kept in mind before you apply for any loan. Although not much effective in raising credit score immediately, a longer tenure of the loan will be useful in many ways. The EMI is calculated based on loan tenure. Therefore, a longer tenure will effectively reduce the EMI. Lessening the financial burden will help you repay the loan without default. This paves the way for a better credit score that will help you access loans without much difficulty. An important point on how to boost credit score immediately.6. Credit-mix is Effective in Augmenting the CIBIL ScoreHow the agency will assess your CIBIL score if you haven’t taken any loans!? The individual, who hasn’t taken any loan in the past, will have a low score. The foremost thing you must contemplate, before searching on how to boost your credit score to 800, is the type of loans you have taken until now. A healthy credit mix of secure and insecure loans is what will give you an advantageous credit score. You can go for a gold loan in lieu of a personal loan, in times of urgent requirements. A secure loan against your name is favorable to a positive credit score. And apply for an unsecured loan in other scenarios. Thus showing a mix of secured and unsecured credit against your name.7. Keep the Old Debt Records in the ReportYou might have closed the previous loans successfully and may think of asking the banks to remove those records from your report. Don’t do that. Keep the records of the successful repayments and loan closure in your report. It will be a positive aspect when you search for how to boost credit score immediately. A record of proper loan repayment points to a trustworthy individual. Which bank will not want to finance a trustworthy individual?8. Avoid Cash Advances on Credit CardA cash advance on a credit card simply implies that you are not good at financial management. It will adversely affect your credit score and may push it down further. Taking a loan on a credit card should be the last option. The gold loan may be a better option in such cases. Moreover, the loan on a credit card will have a higher interest rate compared to all the other finance options making it the least preferred option, to be used only when you cannot arrange funds from any other sources.9. Don’t Use Credit Card for Every PurchasePeople are too eager to use a credit card on every possible occasion. They calculate the profit gained by repaying the money about a month later. Nonetheless, it will not be a good indicator, with respect to the CIBIL authority. The agency may consider you as a spendthrift and bad in money management. A proper balancing of credit card usage with other resources is the right way to manage money.10. Don’t Close the Existing Credit CardsManaging money effectively; by mixing the usage of credit and debit card is more advisable than not using a credit card at all. Closing a credit card will be indicative of your poor economic status and financial management. Keep the credit card open, even if you are not using it much. It would help you maintain a credit score above 800.FAQHow to increase credit score with a credit card?You should maintain the credit card record in the most optimal way. By keeping the credit card open, paying the dues in time, managing the credit card payments perfectly, and avoiding cash advances on a credit card, you can increase your credit score significantly.How to increase credit score without a credit card?This is one of the most relevant questions, as many in India do not use credit cards. You can increase your credit score, even though you are not using a credit card, by becoming an authorized card user, by paying the loans in time, observing a mix of secure and insecure loans, and so on. You may talk to us to know more in this regard.How to increase credit score to 800?800 is the dream number for the borrowers. Most of the debtors want their CIBIL score to be 800 or above.

Does Taking Gold Loan Affect My Credit Score? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Does Taking Gold Loan Affect My Credit Score? June 05, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share A gold loan (also known as a loan against gold) is a secured loan obtained from a lender in exchange for the borrower's gold articles (within a range of 18-24 carats) as collateral. Based on the current market value and quality of gold, the loan sum is a percentage of the gold, usually up to 80%. Nationalized banks, private banks, and other financial institutions provide loans at low gold loan EMI rates. Unlike other loans, which could have certain terms and conditions on how the funds will be used, this loan has no such restrictions. How you perform and maintain your credit payments has an effect on your credit score (a numeric summary of your credit history). Before handing out any loans to customers, the RBI has made it mandatory for banks to check the CIBIL score. Personal loans are riskier for a bank because they are unsecured. A high CIBIL Score, among other things, gives the bank more interest in your ability to pay back the loan. Gold Loans, on the other hand, require you to have leverage in the form of a reasonably liquid tangible commodity, such as gold. Banks are more likely to offer you a loan despite your poor credit score because your Gold asset serves as insurance and protects them from default risk. As a result, when Personal Loans are not an option, Gold Loans can be a viable option. Why is Gold Loan the Best Choice to improve your CIBIL Score? Gold financing is one of the most viable choices among the various types of loans available. In today's world, it's even easier to obtain an instant gold loan because the application process is completed online and Gold Loans may help improve your CIBIL Score. Gold loans have a number of benefits, including low gold loan EMI rates, affordability, and accessibility. But one stands out: it can help you increase your CIBIL score and potentially open up future loan options. Always remember, Repay on Time: Make sure you pay your EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments) on or before the due date, if at all possible. Payment of EMIs on time will begin to improve your credit score. Maintain your focus, and you'll soon have a high CIBIL score and a plethora of opportunities. Avoid Collateral Auction: This is an absolute no-no. While some lenders may be lenient and not penalize you for one or two late EMI payments, it will damage your credit score and adversely affect your gold. Stretch the budget, but don't skip payments at all costs. Please keep in mind that, while Gold Loans are more convenient to obtain, you will be placing your valuable assets at a risk for the duration of the loan. This may be necessary in an emergency, but it may be less than ideal in the long run. Look for ways to boost your credit score and, if applicable, move to an unsecured loan as soon as possible. What are the most typical rates of gold loan EMI and processing fees? Depending on the lender, gold loan EMI rates on gold loans range from 9.24 percent to 17 percent. Some lenders often charge a processing fee that ranges from 1-3 percent of the loan amount. A Gold Loan will help people who need money but have a bad credit score to improve their credit score. Prompt repayment of any loan, even a Gold Loan, will greatly improve your credit score. This would have a greater impact on your credit than a non-secured personal loan, so take out a gold debt and repay it early. Notably, financial institutions do not view late payments of secured loans, especially Gold Loans, in the same way, that they regard late payments of other unsecured loans. Furthermore, interest rates on other unsecured loans could be higher than on gold loans. As a result, Gold Loans can prove to be cost-effective.

Common Mistakes while applying for Gold Loan | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Common Mistakes while applying for Gold Loan June 01, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share Gold loan is the ideal option when you are in urgent need of money. It will help you get the money without losing the asset. However, you need to check the different aspects related to a gold loan. Otherwise, you may end up making mistakes that may turn costly at a later stage. This article is meant for those who consider over the counter, or online gold loan.Taking loans from established, reliable, finance firms like Manappuram would be the best choice. Such entities have made the identity through customer-centric services and the best interest rates. Besides, unfussy processes including online gold loan options.We have analyzed the common mistakes made by customers while applying for a gold loan. Furthermore, we discussed the same with top financial institutions including Manappuram to prepare this article.1. Not Evaluating the Exact Rate of InterestCompanies offering over the counter as well as online gold loans will try to lure the clients through marketing campaigns. They may declare attractive interest rates, concealing the additional charges incurred during the process. You may think the advertised rate is the final one and will apply for the loan. The additional charges would become evident only when you start repaying the amount.2. Turning a Blind Eye to the Terms and ConditionsAt least 90% of the customers don’t read the terms and conditions written in small font, containing numerous clauses regarding the gold loan (for that matter any loan). Rather, they will sign the document blindly, so as not to waste time reading it completely. This may cause you to pay an extra amount as interest. Some of the gold loans may have an increasing type of rate of interest, i.e. the interest rate may go to the next slab after a certain period. Of course, trustworthy finance companies will brief the customer about the gold loan plans. So that he or she can choose the best one.3. Long Payment TenureCustomers often choose a longer repayment period in a bid to reduce the monthly EMI. Many do this to regulate the monthly budget and prevent the instalment from hampering it. Nevertheless, it will lead to the payment of a high amount as interest. Try to avoid this as much as possible.4. Auction of the Assets in case of DefaultThe finance company is authorized to auction the pledged gold asset in case of default in repayments. You need to check the auction terms thoroughly before availing the gold loan. Companies like Manappuram have a laid down procedure which will ensure that the customer is intimated in advance allowing time to arrange the money. You can consult the executives at the firm regarding the gold auction procedure beforehand. Alternatively, read the conditions properly when availing online gold loan.5. After-sales Support from the Finance Company is CrucialThe finance company, from which you avail the gold loan, must be client-centric in every manner. They must be ready to support you if you face any kind of problems concerning loan repayment or any other related issues. Reputed entities like Manappuram Finance, which offers over the counter and online gold loan through a quick process, offer excellent after-sales support as well.The BriefGold loan is a secured loan. Therefore, it will not affect your credit (CIBIL) score much. It would be the right option to find funds during urgent requirements. Nonetheless, choose only trusted firms like Manappuram Finance to avail a gold loan in order to avoid unwarranted issues later. The gold loan should not turn into a harassment for you and your family. Even if you are in a financial crunch, think well before signing the loan documents.

Why do people take gold loans? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Why do people take gold loans? May 20, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share By VP Nandakumar When Manappuram Finance Ltd. first entered the gold loans market in the latter half of the nineties, it also became the first NBFC in India to get into gold loans. Till then, this business was the preserve of the unorganised sector, the pawnbrokers and moneylenders who operated in lanes and by lanes across the country away from the oversight of regulators and policy makers. Indeed, India’s regulatory and policy making establishment (as also decision makers in the banking sector) were largely uninformed about gold loans and why it mattered to so many ordinary Indians. After all, there were no academic papers or studies about the share of gold loans in India’s credit market, and there was little awareness about what made people resort to gold loans. Consequently, in those early days, we found it difficult to convince bankers about the viability of the gold loan business in a corporate setting and getting them to extend loans to us was not easy. Of course, things changed once we had demonstrated by example how a business overlooked by the mainstream financiers could be so relevant to India’s macro economy. Since those early days, gold loans have come a long way but we continued to face a dearth of verifiable data-backed understanding of gold loan customers. The main reason for the lack of representative information is that the gold loan industry is fragmented and dominated by the unorganised and unregulated lenders like moneylenders and pawnbrokers. To this day, less than a third of the estimated gold loan market in India is conducted via banks, non-banks and other registered entities. Over these years, we have tried our best to do what we can to rectify the situation. In the year 2009, we commissioned a study through the ICRA Management Consulting Services Limited (IMaCS) which was published with the title “Gold Loans Market in India, 2009” to become the first serious study of the gold loans sector. We followed this up in 2011 with a survey and study of our own gold loan customers conducted by a senior economist affiliated to the University of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram. In 2012, when the RBI set up the Rao committee to undertake a thorough analysis of the gold loan business, the committee members expressed their frustration that almost no data or reliable information was available about this age-old business. It was true that most of the existing research was based on anecdotal evidence, without hard numbers to back up the conclusions. Accordingly, we had forwarded a copy of our 2011 study of our gold loan customers to the RBI. We understand that it was relied upon during committee deliberations, and it helped establish the positive impact of gold loans on the lives of the masses. It became clear to the committee that gold loans were no longer a distress product, having evolved into a lifestyle credit product. Customers were as comfortable monetising their gold jewellery to meet short-term cash flow mismatches as they were in availing a home loan or an auto loan. The view gained ground that if the gold loan sector is not handled with judicious policy initiatives, people may head back to the unorganised sector dealing a body blow to the cause of social and financial inclusion. The Rao Committee report on India’s Gold Loans sector commissioned by the RBI came out in 2013. Since then, IMaCS has been putting out periodic updates to its original 2009 study. However, there is a perceptible lack of updated studies focused on the gold loan customer. As things stand, much of our understanding of the typical borrower's profile, requirements etc. is based on our own experience gathered over the years. This has a weakness in that bias can creep in, and one’s presumptions can continue to drive the business unmindful of the reality of an ever-changing socio-economic backdrop. After all, customer preferences change, their requirements change, competitive landscapes change and, most importantly, people change! A new study in collaboration with the Gokhale Institute, Pune It is, therefore, of utmost importance to update our understanding of the market, customers, competing products, and the wider socio-economic dynamics. Several studies and reports are available for most of the micro-markets and credit segments, but rarely do we come across a serious, painstaking study about the business of lending against household gold jewellery. That’s why in late 2019, Manappuram engaged the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (Pune), a renowned economic research institution, to conduct a fresh study of its gold loan customers. Established in 1930, the Gokhale Institute is the oldest economic research and training institute in India. It is reputed for its initiatives in qualitative research in diverse areas of economic theory and practice. Its founding director, Shri D.R. Gadgil was a member of the first National Income Committee and the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, the highest bureaucratic position in the Indian economic sector with the rank of a cabinet minister. He is well known as the author of the Gadgil formula which served as the basis for allocation of central assistance to states during the fourth and fifth Five Year Plans. The Institute is credited with pioneering contributions by way of surveys, research, informed debate, analyses and critiques, which have shaped the public discourse on major socio-economic initiatives. It developed a methodology for data collection which is still used by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). On the policy front, the institute designed the institutional framework for NABARD, formulated the Employment Guarantee Scheme and Agricultural Insurance Scheme. It is indeed an honour for Manappuram to be associated with the Gokhale Institute for such an important study. However, no sooner had the spadework for the study commenced that the world was struck by the Covid-19 pandemic. We realised that this event had the potential to alter the course of the future. The customer’s behaviour, perspectives, and preferences related to gold and other credit products must be reassessed. The exercise required undertaking a baseline survey of, and data collection from, gold loan customers. While any researcher would have preferred to have a broad sample for collecting a representative dataset, we had to restrict the data collection to our own customer base on account of customer confidentiality. The fact is, other gold loan lenders would not be comfortable in sharing their customer information with external researchers. The larger purpose of the study was to analyse customer behaviour (using actual transaction data) to make actionable policy recommendations. For this, the study needed to understand the service delivery process, the benefits accruing from gold loan availability, as well as the costs of non-availability. Afterall, unless we understand how customers are likely to behave in the absence of the institutional gold loan, we may miss out on the prospective policy changes required to shift the bulk of the unbanked and underbanked to the institutionalised lending framework. Finetuning the methodology Much of the secondary information concerning the gold loan industry is based on small and fragmented data points. Manappuram has over 25 lakh active customers and a network of nearly 3,500 gold loan branches spread across 28 states/UTs of the country. The target sample was designed using a stratified sampling method for a representative sample and to arrive at an unbiased understanding of the gold loan customers at the national level. We conducted a few pilot sample surveys to fine-tune the questionnaire to make it easier to grasp and derive appropriate responses. As the survey was to be conducted over telephone, it had to be short, yet detailed enough to draw a relevant response. The questionnaire focused on the customer’s experience with gold loans and other loans, experience with institutional (Banks/ NBFC etc.) and non-institutional lenders (moneylenders/ pawnbrokers etc.), their perspective on satisfaction derived from the gold loan, benefits and costs associated with availability and non-availability of gold loan, the changes they desired in the product design, and their preferences regarding ease, cost, tenure etc. As the survey was conducted across India with most respondents belonging to the bottom of the pyramid, we conducted all interactions in their regional language using translated survey questionnaires. We faced many connectivity challenges, often requiring repeated calling to complete all the questions in the survey. The questionnaire took approximately 15 minutes to administer. We managed to generate responses from 3,582 customers who completed the telephonic survey (partial responses were not considered in the study for uniformity). The respondents belonged to 357 districts of 27 states and union territories, giving us a representative all-India sample for better understanding of the role played by gold loans in fulfilling the objectives of responsible lending, including the economic, social, and governance (ESG) agenda of our institutional lenders. Summing up To summarise, a survey study of gold loan customers across India was conducted in early 2020 by the Gokhale Institute of Political Economy, Pune. The study utilised the customer base of Manappuram for collecting borrower responses to the survey questionnaire and the same was matched with their transaction data to undertake a comprehensive analysis of observed customer behaviour. The objective of the survey study was to understand the behavioural and economic aspects of the customers, the purpose and tenure of these borrowings, the factors influencing the decision from where to borrow (banks, non-banks or unorganised), why customers rely on gold loan (cost-benefit vs other alternatives available to them), and the effects of its availability on their lives. In comparison to a survey-only method, this approach of combining it with actual transaction data offers a unique validation of the responses, providing us with a holistic view of the role played by gold loans in their day to day lives. We aim to publish the detailed survey report, its findings, and recommendations (for the lending institutions, regulators and policy makers) in due course. I intend to write more about it once the report is published. Published in Unique Times Magazine, May 2021(Shri V.P. Nandakumar is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd. Views are personal.)

Fluctuating gold prices and risk management in gold loans | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Fluctuating gold prices and risk management in gold loans April 14, 2021AwardsManappuram Finance Share By VP Nandakumar In recent months, gold prices have fallen significantly from the highs recorded last year following the widespread economic disruption after Covid-19. The international price of the metal had crossed US$ 2,000 per troy ounce in August 2020 but has now declined to about US$ 1,700 currently. Given this volatility, it is no surprise that gold loan financiers should be flooded with media queries about the likely impact of such a price correction on their profitability and growth prospects. Having been involved in the gold loan business for decades, I speak from experience when I say that gold price volatility has next to no impact on the gold loan business, barring a short term effect which gets normalised as the new prices become the new normal. Moreover, the gold loan business has also evolved over time to make itself more resilient to these price fluctuations. The change is most apparent in risk management, where the old ways of doing things have given way to new thinking. Risk management in the financial sector is a critical function which determines whether you survive or not in a world where only the fittest survive. As the theory of evolution explains, the survival of the fittest is all about the ability to adapt and change according to the environment. The same rules apply to the corporate world, including in the lending business. For example, if Manappuram Finance Limited (the company that I founded in 1992) had continued to function exactly as it did in the '90s, it would have soon fallen by the wayside. Gold Price trends in IndiaGold prices in India have grown 15-fold in the last 30 years, from about Rs 3,000 in 1992 to Rs 45,000 level today. However, there have also been periods when gold prices went into a bearish phase. In 2012, the RBI stepped in and completely overhauled the functioning of the organised gold loan market by introducing a slew of new regulations, including a cap on the maximum permissible loan to value ratio (LTV). Initially, this cap on LTV was fixed at 60% and within a year revised upwards to 75%. Gold prices fell by 25% over the next two years, before resuming its uptrend in 2015. Thereafter, prices peaked in 2017 and then fell by 15% within a few months. The next upcycle lasted till August 2020 after which gold prices in India have fallen by 19% from Rs 54,500 to Rs 45,000 level currently. Risk mitigation with short-term gold loansWhen we first started lending against gold jewellery, there were no restrictions on loan to value (LTV) ratio, and there were no regulations that limited the amount people could borrow against their jewellery. Gold loans were usually given out for a period of one year and there was no requirement about having to service interest periodically. Indeed, bullet repayment of both the principal and the accumulated interest was the norm. While defaults remained minimal and actual losses were kept well under control, there was an ever-present element of risk to this set-up. Should the price of gold fall significantly after the loan is given out, the realisable value of security would fall below the principal amount and the interest accumulated thereon, leading to the possibility of a loss for the lender should the borrower choose not to repay. The demand for gold loans got a boost in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008. This was partly because of continuously increasing gold prices, the consequence of the ballooning balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve Bank and the large fiscal and monetary stimulus unleashed across the globe. Besides, most of the other borrowing avenues for small business had dried up, leaving gold loans as one of the few remaining options. In 2014, looking at the increasing volatility in gold prices, we at Manappuram decided to shift the bulk of our gold loans to 3 months tenure from the one-year product that was the industry standard. The purpose was to minimize the price risk that gold loans are subject to. The price risk is the risk of loss when the value of the jewellery pledged is no longer sufficient to cover the outstanding loan amount. However, even as we shifted to short-term gold loans, most of the other players continued with the one-year gold loan product. On our part, we were clear in our minds that we were in the business of lending against gold jewellery and not in its trading. We recognised that we do not have expertise in predicting where the gold prices are headed for. When we give out a gold loan for a certain duration (whether three months or one year), the borrower has no obligation to make any payment in the interim, and only needs to repay the principal along with accumulated interest at the time of closure. When he takes a three-month loan, he can renew or rollover his loan account after three months by paying the interest and resetting the loan to the current gold price.Effectively, when we lend against gold for three months, we are taking on the metal price risk for the period, whereas on a gold loan of one year tenure, the lender bears the price risk for the extended period of one year. Further, the compounding interest accrued over the whole year is also to be added. In periods when gold prices keep increasing year after year (as it happened during the bull run in gold from 2003 to 2011), there is perhaps little risk in lending for one year. However, when the tide turns and prices begin to fall, you may end up holding the short end of the stick. Let me elaborate on this risk perspective with an example.At Manappuram, our gold loan products went through three different phases. Before the 2012 regulations capping LTV came into force, we offered gold loans up to 90% of LTV for a tenure of up to a year. For the purpose of this example, let’s call this product Type-C. After the LTV cap was set at 75% by the regulator, we restricted the LTV to 75% but the tenure was still kept at one year (product Type-B). Later, in FY-2015, we introduced our three-month gold loan products at an LTV of 75% (product Type-A).How do these varying product types deal with the gold price risk? In particular, how does the three-month gold loan deal with price risk by its very product design? Let's say in August 2020, when the gold price was Rs.5,500/gm, the company gives out a loan of Rs. 4,125 for three months (renewable) at 75% LTV (product Type-A). At the same time, the company also gives out a loan of Rs. 4,125 for one year at 75% LTV (product Type-B) and another loan of Rs 4,950 for one year at 90% LTV (product Type-C). For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that all these loans carry the same rate of interest at 12% per annum.After August 2020, gold prices started falling. Now let us further assume that the customer won’t have a surplus with him to make good any shortfall in collateral value (arising from a decline in gold price) when closing or renewing the loan. For a loan with a tenure of three months, the NPA classification would kick in after 90 days, i.e., by January/February 2021 (March quarter) while for the one-year tenured loans, the NPA classification would happen in October/November 2021 (December quarter).As the gold price now has fallen to Rs.4,500/gm level, the outstanding loan amount including accrued interest for product "A" would be Rs.4,250, lower than, and adequately covered by, the realisable gold value. In the scrap resale market, auctions typically fetch less than the notional value on account of information asymmetry (the typical lemons problem). If gold prices remain at the same level, by October/November 2021 (December quarter), the outstanding amount for loan product "B" would be Rs. 4,635 which is higher than the total realisable value of the collateral. Similarly, for product "C", the outstanding loan amount would be at Rs.5,545, which is way above the realisable value of the collateral. Indeed, gold prices would need to go up by a massive 23% for these products to recover their dues.However, under our present accounting standards, the one-year loans (B & C) would be reported as standard assets until the December quarter, with the company allowed to show accrued interest as income booked. In truth, the realisable value of the collateral is below even the principal amount. On the surface, the portfolio looks pristine and the company can report healthy growth for a few more quarters, even as the insiders would know that the assets on the book have turned bad (barring a miraculous recovery in gold price). The short-term product "A” carries much lower gold price risk as its duration is only three months and interest accruals happen only for this short period. If the customer fails to settle or renew the account, the lender can initiate the process of recovery by the March quarter itself. However, in the case of the long-term products B & C, the lender would have to wait for another 9 months or so, until October or November 2021 (December quarter), before initiating the recovery process. Should gold prices fall even more over these 9 months, the yield on the asset would suffer even more. Summing up, product "A" is required to take the first punch from the falling gold prices, but it emerges unscathed. Products B & C are likely to take a hard punch to the gut if gold prices don’t recover in the next few months. Apart from the delayed acknowledgement of the deterioration in asset quality, products B & C would continue to report a higher growth in portfolio AUM, whereas product A would have acknowledged all the stresses in the March quarter itself, allowing for prompt corrective action before setting itself up for profitable future growth without the burden of NPAs.At Manappuram, during the previous episode of gold price volatility, we had realised that a short-term gold loan product is the best way to manage the gold price risk and accordingly worked hard to shift our entire gold loan portfolio to the three-month product "A". The short-term product offers benefits both to the customer and to the company. The company is able to manage the price risk and asset quality prudently, without taking away flexibility to the customer in terms of his credit requirements. The periodic renewal of the loan and the regular servicing of interest by the customer enforces credit discipline and it also lowers the interest burden on the customer.

Interest rates in India likely to rise | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Interest rates in India likely to rise March 18, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share Interest rates in India likely to riseBy VP NandakumarAn important development for the Indian economy in recent years has been the remarkable success achieved in lowering interest rates. This came about because the RBI has steadily cut its key policy rate since January 2014 when the repo rate had peaked at 8 per cent. The repo rate has now come down to 4 per cent (the lowest ever) for a total reduction of 4 percentage points over six years. During the global financial crisis of 2008, the repo rate had bottomed out at 4.75 per cent before starting to rise again. Incidentally, the RBI had tried to raise rates briefly from June to August 2018, when it increased the repo rate from 6 to 6.5 percent. In fact, in the March 2018 issue of this publication, my article titled “Are interest rates poised for reversal?” about my expectations of interest rates heading up, proved correct in that the RBI increased the repo rate from 6 to 6.25 per cent in June 2018 and then to 6.5 per cent in August 2018. However, the IL&FS crisis hit the economy towards the end of 2018 and there were no further hikes. The RBI’s move to cut interest rates over the last 3 to 4 years followed the decline in India’s inflation rate and reflected its confidence in the government’s ability to keep a lid on fiscal deficit.During its February 2021 meeting, the RBI left its benchmark repurchase rate at 4 per cent stating that it would maintain an accommodative stance as long as necessary to support the economy hit by the COVID-19 crisis, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The RBI revised its inflation forecast to 5 per cent from 5.2 per cent in H1 2021-22 and 4.3 per cent for Q3 2021-22. Meanwhile, the real GDP growth is projected at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22.The economy-wide decline in borrowing costs has been beneficial to industry and business across sectors and this is one of the reasons why stock markets in India have boomed recently. Against this backdrop, recent events suggest that an unwelcome reversal of the trend may be in the offing. While the RBI has held rates steady since the last cut effected in May 2020, it is the action in the bond market that points to rougher weather going forward.RBI Repo RatesWarning signals from the bond market Thanks to interest rates falling steadily since 2014, the bond market participants enjoyed a rally in prices for much of the last four years. Yields had fallen from their peak of 9.10 per cent in April 2014 to 5.76 per cent in July 2020. The sustained decline in bond yield was mainly due to the easy monetary policy followed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after January 2014, with the repo rate coming down from 8 per cent in 2014 to 4 per cent as of today. The decline in bond yield (in other words, the rally in bond prices) came to a halt by December 2020 as the RBI neared the end of its easy monetary policy cycle. The RBI finds itself unable to push for further rate cuts despite the contraction in GDP for two consecutive quarters (following the pandemic) because of the risk of higher inflation on the back of increased borrowings by the government. Market participants expect that the RBI will likely increase the policy rate in 2H-FY21. The key factor underlining this view is the likelihood of inflation making a comeback, which would cause the RBI to normalize policy sooner than currently expected. In the Union Budget presented in February, the FM budgeted for fiscal deficit at a much higher level than last year’s budget given the pressing need to stimulate economic activities. However, because this necessarily involves higher government borrowing, the bond interest rate cycle turned, resulting in a spike in the cost of borrowing for the government as well as for the highly rated corporates. Yield on the 10-year benchmark bond went up recently. Since the Union Budget was unveiled, the benchmark yields have hardened to 6.20 in March (up by 42 bps). Even the yield on one-year T-bill has increased from 3.40% to 3.70% in February this year. The elevated fiscal deficit shown in the budget was not unexpected. After all, there is a clear need to revive the economy and channel investment into infrastructure, and it was expected that fiscal deficits would likely run higher than base for a couple of years or so. In the corporate bond market, two AAA-rated borrowers had to reduce the size of their debt issuances recently, due to the higher yield demanded by the market. Incidentally borrowing costs for large, AAA-rated PSU's have increased by 80-100 bps over the past few weeks. These days, the bond markets and the RBI are involved in a tug of war over the yield on government securities. The RBI chose to devolve several auctions on the underwriters last month as the market was demanding a higher yield. The RBI wants to keep the government's borrowing costs below 6 per cent, which market participants believe is less than the fair price. In this context, it may be mentioned that the increase in yield on government debt is not unique to India as almost all the large economies have witnessed rising yields on government bonds. Risk of inflation – commodities and oil Fiscal stimulus in the advanced economies can be inflationary too, as we have begun to see in the commodities space where prices have firmed up. With prospects of faster than expected economic revival and with governments across the world loosening their purse strings to stimulate economic recovery, the risk of inflation is real although it may not be significant in the near term (i.e. over the next year). However, the current trends indicate that the period of low commodity prices may have come to an end. After Pfizer’s vaccine announcement revived hopes of a quick end to our pandemic woes, global commodity prices started moving higher on hopes of increasing demand as the pace of economic activities picks up. Commodity prices started rallying from June 2020 onwards thanks to a post-pandemic recovery, rising global liquidity, and a weaker dollar. Steel, cement, coal, copper, aluminium, iron ore, are up by up to 75% since June 2020. Copper and tin prices hit their highest in nine years earlier in February, while crude oil continues to trade at a 13-month high. Oil is a ‘leading’ indicator of growth in the global economy and in 2021, prices went up by 20 per cent within one month reflecting optimism about revival of growth. Moreover, greater compliance by OPEC+ members in respect of their agreed upon production quotas has also supported prices. In April 2020, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, the OPEC+ alliance decided to enforce a 10 million barrel per day (bpd) production cut till June 2020, which gave way to a cut of 7.6 million bpd until the end of the year, and now to a cut of 5.6 million bpd through 2021 until April 2022. Crude oil prices have risen more than 60 per cent since November 2020 when the first vaccine announcement was made. Staying with the outlook for crude oil prices, a further complication is that the new Biden administration in the US is very conscious about the environment. Many of its leading lights are opposed to fossil fuels and keen to force the pace of change towards renewable sources of energy. This is in marked contrast to the pragmatic approach of the Trump administration that had no qualms about encouraging oil prospecting onshore and offshore. While the long-term impact of a shift to renewable sources of energy would be positive, there are short term costs to be borne. Under Trump, on each occasion that oil prices rose above US$ 60 to the barrel, shale oil producers would ramp up their output and keep a lid on prices. In fact, thanks to the rise of shale oil, the US had effectively become a net-zero importer of crude oil. But now, with a new dispensation under the influence of environmentalists and climate warriors, there is less likelihood of domestic shale oil producers stepping up their output to keep a check on OPEC’s ability to raise prices. Against this backdrop, crude oil may well continue its rally to US$ 80 and above, which does not bode well for India’s battle against inflation. The negative impact of rising yields The overshooting of the fiscal deficit in the past and the revised higher deficit estimated for the current FY 2021-22 will put further pressure on bond yields. The rising yield increases inflationary pressure (by pushing up costs for producers) and can lead to a slowdown in private investment and economic growth. As the supply of government bonds increases, it tends to “crowd out” private borrowers and forces up interest rates for them. Banks are also adversely affected by rising yields as it erodes bond prices and the value of their existing bond portfolio. The higher mark to market losses that banks are forced to book will further erode their profitability at a time when it is already strained by non-performing loans. The cost of raising deposits for banks has also increased in recent months. Corporate entities are finding it harder to borrow from banks at competitive rates. Earlier, higher-rated corporate could borrow via corporate bonds at lower yields compared to bank borrowings. In a scenario of rising yields in the bond market, this window is also becoming costlier. Outlook As in India, bond markets in the advanced economies have also witnessed rising yields (and falling prices). US government's fiscal response to the great recession of 2008 was to the tune of $1.8 trillion, whereas the fiscal response to the pandemic has ballooned to $6.1 trillion and counting. Recently, the US Treasury bond yield jumped from 0.53 per cent in July 2020 to 1.42 per cent in March (nearly 90 bps jump in less than six months). It must be noted that pre-Lehman the US treasury yield was nearly 5 per cent. In this context, any deviation by the Indian government from the path of fiscal prudence will further pressurise the 10-year benchmark yield given the limited scope of help from the central bank. And that, as we have seen, can only make things more difficult for corporate borrowers who are now well-advised to get used to a period of belt-tightening.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Gold: Outlook for 2021 and the competition from crypto currencies February 17, 2021NewsManappuram Finance Share By VP Nandakumar Gold was one of the best performing major assets of 2020, which will go down in history as the year of the great pandemic. Its rise was driven primarily by the flight to safety and diminished risk appetite in the face of the worldwide economic slump. Gold is, after all, known as a safe haven asset. Once the pandemic began to wreak havoc, its rise was only to be expected. Gold has historically performed well amid equity market pullbacks as well as in periods of high inflation when currencies depreciate or lose value. In the years when global inflation was higher than 3%, gold’s price increased by 15% on average. Moreover, studies show that gold would do well in periods of deflation too. Such periods are typically characterized by low-interest rates and high financial stress, all of which tend to enhance the safe haven demand for gold. Further, gold has been more effective in preserving its value over the past decade when global money supply has surged. During this period, gold has delivered returns well in excess of US T-bills, thereby helping investors preserve capital. For the current calendar year 2021, economic growth in the world is expected to recover from its dismal performance in 2020 though it may remain anaemic (relative to its potential) for some time to come. With weak economic growth and the high price of gold, global consumer demand for gold is likely to remain subdued. At the same time, in keeping with its safe-haven status, gold did attract investment interest from central banks and the gold exchange traded funds (ETFs). Furthermore, the weakness in the US dollar and falling yields on bonds have also acted as a catalyst in maintaining a broad upward momentum for gold prices. Gold and India India is one of the gold capitals of the world, with a third of the world’s gold passing through its borders. In 2005, some 2,470 metric tons of gold were produced worldwide which increased steadily to an estimated 3,300 metric tons in 2019. China leads the world in the production of gold with about 420 metric tonnes produced in 2019, while Australia comes second with a production of 330 metric tonnes. India produces little gold of its own, yet it holds perhaps the largest stock of gold in the world. This stock of privately held gold (owned by households and religious bodies) is estimated at about 30,000 tonnes. It is more than the combined gold held by the central banks of the United States, the Eurozone, and China. A good chunk of this gold would have been passed down for generations, but it is also supplemented by regular imports. India is a large consumer of gold, with official imports averaging 800 tons per year between 2012-2017, worth an estimated annual value of $30 billion. But then, contrary to the common belief that most gold imports are consumed by India’s large domestic market, our trade data shows that an average of 156 tons of gold jewellery—worth about $8 billion—exits India each year. Gold jewellery exports from India represent about one-fifth of the total amount of gold imported to India each year. In other words, for every 5 kg of gold that comes in, nearly 1 kg goes out as exported jewellery. Outlook for 2021 One would expect that an improving world economy rebounding from the pandemic induced disruptions and expectations of a predictable international trade regime (compared to the Trump era of constant upheaval in trade relations) would tend to keep gold prices on the defensive. However, that would be a simplistic assessment. In the medium to the longer-term, gold will draw support from the continuing accommodative monetary policy being followed by most central banks in their quest to support the economic recovery. The low interest rate regime that follows loose monetary policies (some developed economies are seeing negative interest rates) would incentivize investments into gold because the opportunity cost of holding gold comes down. Further, in the aftermath of the pandemic, governments across the world have stepped up their spending to record levels at the cost of ballooning fiscal deficits, giving rise to fears of a resurgence in inflation. Forecasters believe that gold prices are headed higher for the next year with targets of $2,150 and $2,390 (per ounce) on concerns about slower-than-expected global economic recovery and the increased injection of money into the economy as part of stimulus measures. Credit Suisse expects gold to continue its upward trajectory and average $2,100/oz in 2021, peaking at $2,200/oz in the third quarter, but a tad low from their previous estimate of $2,500/oz. Goldman Sachs holds a $2,300-per-ounce price target for gold, implying prices higher by 20%+ from current levels. Cryptocurrency, an emerging contender for safe haven status? Investors are becoming uncomfortable with the surge in money printing by central banks and that has also led to the ongoing rush of investments into digital cryptocurrency. The balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve has jumped from $4 trillion to around $7 trillion in 2020, a 75% growth in a single year, thereby expanding the supply of dollars at an unprecedented pace. The debasement of the US dollar has been a major source of support to gold prices. However, the returns on gold during the year have been far outstripped by the multi-fold rise in digital cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the most famous of the cryptocurrencies, rose 700% in 2020 and, over the course of the last 5 years, it has given returns of 85 times! As a result, investors are considering shifting a part of their portfolios from gold to bitcoins. Unlike fiat currencies like the dollar or the rupee, the supply of a cryptocurrency cannot be increased by any government or central bank, a fact that gives great comfort to its investors. JPMorgan claims that the red-hot cryptocurrency could rally as high as $146,000 as it competes with gold as an “alternative” currency. Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $600 billion. According to JPMorgan, it would have to climb by 4.6 times to match the $2.7 trillion of private sector gold investment. While Bitcoin leads the Cryptos, it is followed by Ethereum with a market cap of $150 billion, and Steller, XRP, Tether, Chainlink with $25 billion market capitalization. All put together, the top 20 cryptocurrencies have a combined market cap of $900 billion. Today, the size of the crypto market has reached a third of the private sector gold investments (a third of this gold is held by Indian households) in just a decade. (Bitcoin, the first ever crypto currency, came into existence in late 2009.) A pertinent question that comes to mind is, what would have been the price of gold today had Bitcoin (and other crypto currencies) not come into existence? It’s a question that has no hard and fast answers. However, one can be sure that had Bitcoin not emerged as an alternative, gold prices would have continued to march on to new record highs.

Converting large NBFCs to banks: is it warranted? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Converting large NBFCs to banks: is it warranted? January 31, 2021Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share By V.P. Nandakumar An internal working group of the RBI recently suggested that large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) should convert themselves into Banks. Although reported in the media as a new suggestion, the fact is, conversion of a non-bank to a bank has been allowed since 2016 when RBI announced ‘on-tap’ universal bank licenses. A couple of non-banks did go on to receive the license and became Banks. In effect, the recent discussions do not change the regulatory aspect much for non-banks who are or were willing, to become a bank. However, it may be a precursor to stricter regulation for those large NBFCs who choose not to. In this context, I am often asked about my stance on this issue, and the consistent answer I give is that given the choice, we would prefer to continue as a non-bank. The rationale is simple. It is the answer to the question, “Should I do something just because I can do that, or should I stick to doing that which I am good at, and which I do best?” There are many reasons why non-banks may find the option of converting into a bank not worth pursuing. Conversion may not be worthwhile The first is the high cost of conversion and the need to fulfil extant regulatory requirements from day one. This includes things like maintaining the required investments for SLR (18 per cent) and CRR (3 per cent) which does not apply to NBFCs. As a bank, effectively 21 per cent of the book would earn a return far lower than the average yield on a lending portfolio, in fact, even lower than the borrowing cost. Also, for a gold loan NBFC, meeting the 40 per cent priority sector lending (PSL) norms is a major challenge given that in the current dispensation, gold loans dispensed by NBFCs are specifically excluded from PSL benefits. (Gold loans account for 72 per cent of Manappuram’s total loan portfolio.) Besides, there is nothing certain about the presumed benefit of conversion, i.e., access to low-cost current and savings account deposits. The cost of deposits need not fall to the expected extent. This is seen in the fact that the cost of deposits for most of the newly minted Banks and Small Finance Finance Banks continues to be well above the industry average. Once an NBFC becomes a bank, it would necessarily have to diversify the portfolio. This can be disconcerting to NBFCs who have earned their spurs as specialised or niche players, catering to well-defined and narrow segments of the market, with specialised knowledge and skills. The consequence will be that product innovations will end up taking a back seat. Most product innovations in financial services can be traced back to non-banks. It comes about because they benefit from a light-touch regulatory approach (compared to banks) which gives them the flexibility to experiment with different innovative ideas and work towards their perfection. Be it housing loans, vehicle loans or gold loan, all these products were innovated and scaled up by NBFCs before banks adopted these products. Forcing NBFCs to convert may mean an end to the era of financial innovations. Of course, smaller non-banks would still be able to invest in innovations, but as soon as they reach a defined size, the process of conversion to a bank would kick in, increasing their cost of risk capital. Converting to a bank would also imply a forced diversification and hence loss of the niche identity created over many years. Non-banks have crafted their business model to suit well-defined target customer segments. There is not one NBFC in India that aims to serve every segment of the market in the way most universal banks do. When compelled to service customers that you are not otherwise equipped to, the impact on the financial system could be negative. For instance, at Manappuram, our niche is gold loans, and our competition is from non-institutional lenders like moneylenders, pawnbrokers, jewellers. To compete against them, we have to be flexible and agile in offering products and services at a low cost, which is not easy for a large and relatively slow-moving banking institution. Banks provide comprehensive universal banking services to their customers. Most non-banks would lack the required skill-sets, infrastructure or technology to provide such a broad range of services. It would entail huge investments in manpower, infrastructure, and technology which will depress their return on capital. This, in turn, increases the cost of raising further capital, leaving them more vulnerable. Regulatory arbitrage, the only attraction The only material benefit from converting to a bank is the regulatory arbitrage for banks. For example, banks do not need prior approval from RBI for opening new branches while gold loan focused NBFCs with more than 1,000 branches need prior approval for opening new branches. A brief comparison of the regulatory norms applicable to Banks (high compliance requirements) and non-banks (light-touch framework) is given in the table below.Bank (High compliance burden)Systemically Important NBFC (Light-touch)Banks still follow old accounting norms, not yet ready to migrate to Ind-AS. RBI is yet to announce the implementation date.Migrated to Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) in convergence with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) per regulation.Capital adequacy ratio for banks is calculated using risk-adjusted capital norms. All assets attract a flat 100 per cent risk weight, irrespective of the asset class. (Would this, effectively, nudge some non-banks to take on higher risks?)Gold loans up to 90 per cent of LTV allowed until 31 March 2021. (Will revert to 75 per cent afterwards.)Gold loan LTV capped at 75 per cent Lending against gold jewellery attracts “ZERO” risk weight. Theoretically, ZERO risks in case of gold loan for banks. Flat 100 per cent risk, irrespective of the LTV (Loan to value) or the loan tenureNo need of prior approval from RBI for opening branchesGold loan NBFC with more than 1,000 branches require prior approval for opening new branches [which can be time-consuming). Gold loans qualify for Priority Sector Lending (PSL) status. Eligible for government interest subsidy (as with Agricultural loans).PSL benefits for gold loans dispensed by NBFCs were withdrawn in 2011.As will be apparent, Banks do have to comply with some extra regulations which do not apply to non-banks, such as SLR, CRR, PSL targets etc. At the same time, there is a perception that banks carry a lower risk compared with non-banks due to low concentration and diversified asset book (lending + investment). There is also a perception that banks have better governance standards than non-banks. However, considering the recent as well as past cases of malfeasance in banks leading to large losses, this may just be a matter of perception. There is also a feeling that banks, being custodians of public money, have to be strictly regulated compared to non-banking institutions who operate under a light-touch regulatory framework. The RBI has used this term more often to suggest that non-banks are not regulated enough. Therefore, the case that they may pose a systemic risk to the financial system and hence to undergo conversion to a bank over a threshold book size. Whether the threshold should be Rs 50,000 crores or Rs 5,000 crores is a matter of further discussion. The real question which needs to be addressed is, “What is the objective of RBI in asking non-banks to convert to a bank?” Is it financial stability? If yes, is this the best option? What about financial inclusion? And finally, is it optional or mandatory? Answering these questions would enable us to address the challenges effectively. There may be tangible benefits for some non-banks in converting to banks but not for all the large NBFCs. The point is not that these non-banks cannot operate as a bank (they certainly can) but that they may not do a good job of it. After all, there is little point in transitioning from an innovative NBFC efficiently serving a niche customer base to a mediocre bank that pleases none. With best wishes for a happy new year!

Strengthen India’s debt market to strengthen NBFCs | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Strengthen India’s debt market to strengthen NBFCs December 08, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. Nandakumar It’s well known that in recent years India’s banks have been grappling with high levels of non-performing assets (NPAs). This problem came to light in 2014-15 when the Reserve Bank of India, suspecting that NPAs were being under-reported over the years, introduced tougher norms for NPA recognition under an Asset Quality Review. The result was that NPAs in 2015-16 almost doubled over the previous year. With the consequent sharp increase in provisioning, many banks have suffered severe erosion of their capital base. This, in turn, constrained their ability to lend in tune with the requirements of the growing economy. Since credit is the lifeblood of the economy, India stood to suffer badly under these circumstances. However, as things turned out, it was not as gloomy as one would have feared, only because the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) stepped up to the plate. Consider these figures. The lending book of India’s NBFCs has grown at a rate of 18 per cent in the last five years, while the sector’s contribution to total credit has increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in just three years. The NBFC sector has played a pivotal role in meeting the financial needs of individuals and businesses that have traditionally remained un-served or underserved by banks. NBFCs are now recognized as last-mile financiers with proven ability to lend to those marginalised sections of society that commercial banks would not have deemed credit-worthy. Also, most of them are niche players who approach their business with focused attention and unique insights which allows them to devise innovative ways to address the special needs of their target segment. And innovation allows them to generate profits out of businesses that mainstream players would dismiss as losing propositions. The funding challenge for NBFCs While NBFCs are seen as a segment distinct from the banks, the fact remains that the major source of funding for NBFCs even today is the banks. This is especially true for the non-deposit taking NBFCs. In FY2017, borrowings from banks made up 21.2 per cent of NBFC borrowings, which jumped to 23.6 per cent in FY2018 and 29.2 per cent in FY2019. This reliance on banks for meeting a large share of their funding requirement comes at a price. It has meant that NBFCs have often had to face difficulties in lending to even their deserving customers because of inadequate funding arising from the weakening credit profile of the banks. The reliance on bank funding was not without its blessings as it was easier for NBFCs to raise money at lower costs when the going was good. However, whenever the tide turned, it would become difficult and costly. The fact is, banks have acted mostly as fair-weather friends, lending an umbrella in clear weather and taking it back when it rained. This kind of risk-averse behaviour is perfectly understandable because banks are, after all, custodians of the depositors’ money. And so, after the 2018 default by one of India’s largest NBFCs (IL&FS) highlighted the problem of asset-liability mismatches across the sector, banks have generally turned wary of lending to NBFCs. Matters were not helped when the leading NBFC engaged in housing finance, Dewan Housing Finance Ltd., also went under subsequently. Given the risk aversion of the banks, over the last two years there has been a change in the funding scenario for NBFCs. The days of banks being the primary source of funds for NBFCs may well be coming to an end. These days NBFCs are raising funds in the markets at ultra-cheap rates even though the banking system sits on a huge surplus while still reluctant to lend to NBFCs. Bond market as the alternative to banks India’s financial markets are still a work-in-progress and there’s a dearth of alternatives to bank funding, especially for the long-term. The solution, therefore, is to deepen India’s bond markets that would free NBFCs from excessive dependence on banks to make the occasional failures like IL&FS less traumatic for the banking and financial system. The development of an active and liquid corporate bond market will greatly help in the transparent and efficient financing of business and industry, especially NBFCs. The question may now be asked, ‘What prevents the growth of the bond market in India?’Well, factors such as the dominance of banks in lending, the limited risk appetite of individuals, requirement of higher credit ratings, tax arbitrage, and prescriptive regulatory limits on investments have all played a part. Also, retail participation in debt markets is minimal even though the psyche of the Indian investor is skewed towards fixed income instruments (as much as 47% of the annual household financial savings flowing into bank deposits.) And so, India’s corporate bond market’s penetration or outstanding corporate bonds as a percentage of gross domestic product is abysmally low (around 15 per cent) compared to many of its emerging market peers, like Brazil and Turkey. In Turkey, non-government bond issuances jumped from less than $1 billion in 2010 (0.2 per cent of government issuances) to over $18 billion (12.82 per cent of government bonds) in 2020. There is, thus, an urgent need to deepen the bond markets with larger participation from the retail investors so that NBFCs can shift from banks to the bond market for the bulk of their funding needs. A good start may be made by having the on-tap public issue of bonds directly to investors, enabling corporates to raise funds regularly at lower issuance cost. The main challenge faced by the investors is the illiquidity of bonds, as each issuance is a new instrument, unlike equity shares where all the follow-up issues are part of the same instrument. It may be worthwhile to explore the issuance/ re-issuance of perpetual debt securities (to be traded on a clean price mechanism, just like G-Sec) allowing higher liquidity and larger participation of investors. For borrowers, it would lower the funding cost with transparent price discovery. The bond market also requires a functional trading platform with a central counterparty facility like that for government securities. We also need insurance products like credit default swaps for an active secondary market for corporate bonds. The bottom line is to do away with opacity when it comes to underlying assets. The Indian bond market is reasonably large in Asia. However, it is dominated by government securities. Attention should be given to bringing about further growth and diversification in the corporate bond market since it is currently lagging relative to peer countries. Why it matters for NBFCs NBFCs have been at the forefront of innovations in financial services which banks go on to adopt later. The culture that produces innovations thrives best under a light-touch regulatory structure. Regulations are a product of rational thought, whereas innovations emerge from out-of-the-box thinking. Innovations cannot thrive under a heavy hand as encouraging the innovation culture requires a higher tolerance for failure. Innovations are like start-ups where the failure rate is high, yet the one that survives and flourishes, goes on to redefine the sector. If India’s NBFCs have succeeded against the odds so far, it’s because they have been lightly regulated all these years compared to the banks. In the banking sector, failures come at a high cost and hence the need for rigorous regulations to prevent downsides. In the post IL&FS scenario, there is pressure on the regulators to tighten up their oversight of NBFCs.Indeed, as long as NBFCs depend primarily on banks for their funding (considered as money belonging to the public), the regulators will be under pressure to tighten their grip as any default involving public funds is bound to be controversial. And that, as we have seen, would be detrimental to the innovation culture of NBFCs. That’s why a shift in the funding pattern of NBFC’s towards the bond market and away from dependence on banks would be hugely positive for the financial sector, as it would also help NBFCs retain their innovative edge.

Gold Loan and Repayment | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Gold Loan and Repayment November 20, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share For generations now, gold has managed to attract admiration. It isn't just jewellery, it has also been a saviour for many, acting as collateral to get hold of some quick loans. Gold has come a long way from pawnbroking to becoming one of the most prized collaterals that, when pledged, can avail you hassle-free loans from banks and NBFCs alike. Gold loan is a secured loan as it is provided against collateral unlike other loans in the market like personal loans or credit card loans. Being a secured loan, gold loans come at a lower cost than unsecured loans and hence are relatively easy to pay off. Banks and NBFCs have been competing to provide the cheapest gold loans available in the market and have classified gold loans based on the mode of repayment. Let's take a quick look at the modes of repayment here:Payment in PartsYou may make the payments in part (interest and principal amounts) at the time of your choice. You could even opt to pay the interest and principal amount completely or in parts without any constraints of a fixed schedule. Repaying the principal initially will also reduce your interest which is usually calculated on the outstanding loan amount.Pay Interest first & Pay Principal LaterThe payments would only include the interest component while the principal (the whole borrowed amount) can be paid once the loan reaches maturity. This mode sees to it that the borrowers don't get holes burnt in their pockets as regular payment of insurance prevents the compounding effect, which otherwise can become burdensome. Bullet RepaymentNo interest payment, and no repayment of principal until the end of the loan term. We agree it is a bit hard to believe but yes, the bullet repayment mode is real. Here, you don’t have to deal with EMIs. You have to repay the whole amount (including the principal and the accumulated interest) at the end of the term as a single lumpsum payment.Gold loans also let you prepay the whole amount at any moment you like without attracting any prepayment charges or penalty. They usually have a short loan tenure but it can be renewed almost indefinitely. Paying off the outstanding loan amount and the up-to-date interest will close your loan account with the lender and you will be handed over the gold which belongs to you.

The New Normal at Manappuram | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The New Normal at Manappuram November 16, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarEver since the outbreak of Covid-19 forced authorities to impose lockdowns and other restrictive measures, organisations around the world have been engaged in a race against time to reinvent and transform themselves and become battle ready for the “new normal.”The new normal is more than just another jargon; in fact, it refers to the altered situation in the world today where many of the old ways of doing things have become irrelevant. The organisational changes to adjust and adapt to the changed ground realities (relating to both economic and social aspects) has created a new challenge for business and industry, i.e. how to respond effectively to this new normal.In this article, I wish to highlight some of transformational changes that we have put through at Manappuram Finance. I am convinced these are changes that will go on to outlive the pandemic itself. While these transformations happened in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic to meet the near-term challenges, their benefits will continue to accrue for long due to the efficiency gains they bring about.Earlier, in this magazine’s September issue, I had written at length in general terms about digitisation and virtualisation in the article titled “Virtualisation is the new Industrialisation”. It now follows that I also highlight what challenges we faced in bringing about change in my own organisation, and what the long-term benefits offered by these transformations would be like.To start with, I must clarify that we had embarked on the digitisation drive even before the pandemic; in fact, I would say that the demonetisation exercise of November 2016 was an earlier trigger point that set in motion this trend towards accelerated digitisation.However, after the pandemic, the speed at which we adopted these transformative changes was breathtaking. Within a few days of the lockdown announcement, we succeeded in extending work from home facilities to all our 22,000 employees. This was feasible only because of the technology initiatives we had implemented over the previous four or five years.Necessity being the mother of invention, the pandemic acted as a catalyst in the faster adoption of digitisation and the virtualisation processes. While the list of organisational changes made within Manappuram is long, I would like to focus on those that have much wider possibilities of adoption by other companies, irrespective of the industry or the scale of their activity. These transformative changes are well suited for MSME, government, educational insitutions, healthcare and other sectors. Some of them would be beneficial at the personal or social level too.Digital TrainingEvery organisation, large or small, has to train its manpower about their products, processes, policies and so on. Moreover, in times when the pace of change has accelerated, organisations have no choice but to empasise learning as a continuous process. As a leader in the NBFC space, Manappuram Finance believes strongly in providing adequate training and learning opportunities to our employees. We have been providing classroom training programs from on-boarding to on-the-job training. We gave our employees over 700,000 hours of training in FY19, averaging 35 hours of training per employee delivered through our 32 Regional Training Centers. This figure jumped to over 10,00,000 hours in FY20, averaging about 53 hours of training per employee. Coordinating these training programs is a herculean task. At Manappuram, we made the transition from classroom trainings to virtual classes to eLearning courses, thereby saving a lot of time and money, including from the elimination of 32 regional training centres. We prepared over 400 eLearning courses of over 220 hours duration and now Learning Management System is the main platform for learning and development at our Company. Micro eLearning courses are the tool for updating each employee with the latest development in their field of expertise. We introduced pre-training modules so that employees are adequately trained for their next role, and prepared to hit the ground running.We are implementing augmented reality (AR) framework in our training programs to create near real, yet fully virtual classroom environment. AR is the merging of the physical and the digital world in a way that combines the best of both online and offline, in one platform. Offline learning through classroom traning helps trainees to gain insight and understanding not only from the trainer, but also from their peers through Q&A and other interactions. But theoretical learning can only stretch so far, employees need to have a hands-on experience to complete their task efficiently and effectively. AR infused training program would be transformative for imparting role critical training and getting the employees ready for future challenges. AR has the potential to revolutionise the learning industry completely.Imagine the vast benefits of such learning systems in the healthcare industry where AR offers sizable learning opportunites without the need to experiment on live patients while learning (with all the chances of making a costly mistake). Hands on skills, such as surgery for doctors or jewellery appraisal in the gold loan business, have a steep learning curve and takes a lot of cognitive effort. AR can help to overcome these barriers, allowing learners to experience, imbibe, and test the skills that they learn. In an AR training environment, employees interact in simulated environments, streamlining both communication and skills development, thus enabling in-the-moment learning. Technological transformation in the learning space is only starting and we are clear that Manappuram will lead from the front.Green Office (Virtual Office)The next set of transformative change is the virtualisation of the office environment. Gone are the days when your working day began when you entered the office and ended when you left for the day. Some industries, specially the IT enabled services, had adopted this framework early on. The pandemic forced non-IT, customer centric businesses to relook at the virtual office framework after having tailored it to meet their needs.Manappuram has been investing heavily in creating the virtual infrastructure needed to meet the demands of the next decade and more. Manappuram was the first gold loan NBFC to launch the online gold loan (OGL) application, today the most successful application of its kind in the industry. Although the app was launched five years ago, adoption was relatively slow but once the pandemic hit us, there was a marked pick-up. Before the lockdown, OGL accounted for about 45% of our gold loan business, but now it is approaching 70%. We started our Green Office project by implementing the paperless system of moving files so that there are no paper files to be moved about anymore. The focus was on making systems and procedures paperless, and tech initiatives were launched to make the operations at Head office completely paperless. Today, everything is digital, saving trees and many hours of manual file movements.The second set of changes came out of compulsion with physical travel having been grounded by the pandemic. We therefore had to move to virtual meetings. Earlier, I used to spend an average of two to three days every week on travel but in the past seven months, I have not stepped out of my office at all. Today, we conduct all our meetings online through various digital platforms. On any given day, I hold multiple meetings with with people from different locations across India and even abroad, and all these meetings are held one after the other, without any loss of time. In earlier days, this would have entailed tiring travel for hours, even days. No surprise then that virtual meetings are here to stay and even though it may not fully replace physical meetings, the advantages are enormous. In fact, now that I have tasted the fruits of the digital office, I am sure I wouldn’t want it any other way!

Stagflation, a risk India must guard against | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Stagflation, a risk India must guard against October 22, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarFormer Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, writing in The Hindu newspaper in November 2019, had warned about the imminent risk of stagflation facing the economy. At the time, India’s economic growth was slowing down. Nearly a year later, we are staring at a contracting economy. Interestingly, back in March 2013, when Dr. Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, Mr. C. Rangarajan, who was then Chairman of the PM’s Economic Advisory Council, had co-authored a paper titled `Growth or Austerity: The Policy Dilemma’, giving the exact same warning that India’s economy faced the risk of stagflation.Of course, it may be argued that India’s recent shift from a trend of decelerating growth to one of outright contraction is the direct consequence of the outbreak of Covid-19 and the extraordinary measures such as lockdowns taken to contain its spread. However, the slowdown in GDP had begun well before the onset of the pandemic. In its last policy review, the RBI had forecast India’s GDP growth would be “negative” in FY21 (due to prolonged lockdown), the first instance of economic contraction since the 1991 liberalisation. After independence, India has observed negative GDP growth in a total of five years, 1958 (-1.21), 1965 (-2.64%), 1966 (-0.05%), 1972 (-0.5%), and 1979 (5.2%). Bear in mind that GDP growth in the pre-liberalisation period averaged just 3.9% over 45 years, while the recent average (over the last 25 years) is over 6.5% annualised growth.What is stagflationAn economy is stated to be in stagflation when inflation runs high and the growth stuck at low levels. The Indian economy has now faced eight consecutive quarters of slowing growth since mid-2018. For long, the conventional view among economists was that there is a stable inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. They argued that inflation should be considered tolerable because it meant the economy was growing and unemployment would be at low levels. Their belief was that an increase in the demand for goods and services drives up prices, which in turn encourages firms to expand and hire additional employees, creating additional demand throughout the economy.The simultaneous occurrence of high inflation along with low or stagnant economic growth (i.e. stagflation), challenges the conventional view that inflation helps an economy operate at full capacity. Historically, stagflation first arose in the mid-1970s, when the US economy faced a prolonged slump accompanied by high unemployment and rising inflation. The trigger was the announcement of an oil embargo by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in October 1973. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen nearly 300 percent from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally. As oil prices reached new heights, productive capacity was severely disrupted. The US Federal Reserve tried to address the situation by cutting interest rates and boosting money supply, but the sharp increase in oil prices drove the prices of everything else higher (cost-push inflation). According to the theory in vogue at the time, inflation should have had an inverse relationship with unemployment and a positive relationship with economic growth. However, as it turned out, the 1970s was an era of both rising prices and rising unemployment. The slowdown in economic growth was the consequence of the cost-push inflation set off by high oil prices. India’s growth woesThe current episode of slowdown in the Indian economy beginning in 2018 can be attributed to a lack of consumer demand which leads to lower utilisation of existing manufacturing capacity, and further, to lower employment. Incidentally, the year 2018 is also when the NBFC sector in India ran into major headwinds following the default by IL&FS, until then a highly rated NBFC engaged primarily in financing infrastructure projects. Considering that India’s banking sector has been reeling for many years under a deluge of NPAs, it was actually the NBFCs that had picked up the slack to drive much of the incremental credit growth in the country.Strictly speaking, falling demand and lower growth calls for greater spending by the government and a cut in interest rates by the central bank to resuscitate the economy. But stagflation essentially ties their hands and renders them incapable of taking such countercyclical policy steps. If the central bank decides to inject fresh money into the economy, either by cutting its benchmark interest rate or other unconventional means, it could lead to further rise in prices and make things worse. A similar rise in inflation would follow if the government engages in deficit spending that is funded by the RBI (i.e. monetising the fiscal deficit). All this is bad news at a time when the economy is not functioning at its full capacity, with significant unemployed resources. The dilemma is that if the slowdown in growth persists for long, it will dent the incomes of the people. On the other hand, higher inflation will likely lead to a reduction in our standard of living as people are able to afford less.Some economists suggest that policymakers should stop worrying about inflation and instead focus exclusively on boosting aggregate demand in the economy. They consider the RBI’s target of holding inflation below 6 percent as an arbitrary target and recommend that the central bank should further ease its policy stance in tandem with the government spending more on infrastructure and other sectors to boost the economy. Some other economists see the severe fall in consumer demand as the natural consequence of a credit-fuelled boom that had to come to an end sooner or later. They advocate supply-side reforms to bring about genuine economic growth by increasing productive capacity operating at higher efficiency levels as to bring down costs and increase affordability.India’s economy is placed in a difficult position currently. Income levels are stagnant, and household consumption is slowing. People are dipping into their savings to maintain their usual consumption. In this scenario, if inflation continues to increase along with stagnant demand and high unemployment, we will likely head into ‘stagflation.’ This is a dangerous territory from which large economies would find it difficult to extricate themselves.India is now a $3-trillion global economic powerhouse driven largely by private enterprise. The slowing down of the Chinese economy and its exports have opened up opportunities for greater export to Indian firms. Further, international investors continue to repose faith in India’s economic prospects and have invested record sums of money as FDI and FPI, thanks to which our forex reserves are at record highs. This is a major comfort for India as it seeks to garner an elephant’s share of this newly opened-up export opportunities by fostering a climate of economic dynamism. With global oil prices at comfortable lows, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to catapult India to a higher orbit of economic development and thereby create jobs for the millions who enter our workforce each year.Published in Unique Times Magazine, October 2020(The writer is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.

Getting the economy back to shape, post-pandemic | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Getting the economy back to shape, post-pandemic August 06, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. Nandakumar Economists often use the term “ceteris paribus”, Latin for "all other things held constant" when positing their theories or making predictions based on their models. I am not an economist but as the CEO of a large NBFC, I take a keen interest in India’s economic performance, mainly to get a sense of where things are headed. After all, the wider performance of the economy has a crucial bearing on business performance. But these days, we are in the midst of an unprecedented situation where even near-term predictions are difficult to make because we have no clue about how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out. When Unlock 1.0 began in May, we were hopeful of returning to normalcy within a couple of months. However, three months down the line, the situation continues to be dire as we head back to more of localised lockdowns and curfews. Most of our states are reporting an increasingly higher number of positive cases than before. As we come to grips with the ground realities, the one good news is that India has ramped up its testing capacity and that nearly two crore people have been tested so far. In the meantime, work on developing a vaccine is going on at a frenetic pace. India is also in the race to develop a vaccine with trials of our Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, having started at 8 sites. Meanwhile, the medical profession is working tirelessly to develop a treatment protocol that would cure the disease and cut down on the fatality rates. While we are grateful to our medical professionals, and even as we hope for the best, we must simultaneously work to get the economy back on track. Otherwise, we may fail ourselves by saving the lives of our citizens but destroying their livelihoods. It is increasingly clear that a lockdown is not a real solution as it only buys time at best. In that sense, it’s no better than kicking the can down the road. What’s more, it comes at a steep cost to the livelihoods of some of our poorest and most vulnerable sections. Therefore, what we need is to balance the precautionary measures with measures to support economic activity that would preserve livelihoods. Governments have a responsibility to protect both lives and livelihood. In this context, lockdowns serve one purpose very well but at the cost of the other. We have now seen for ourselves how lockdowns destroy the livelihoods of the poor and marginalised people, be it labourers, shopkeepers, traders or MSMEs. There is also a widely shared view among economists that the Indian government’s fiscal response to the economic crisis has been inadequate. According to this view, the government should ramp up spending without heed to the deficit financing it would entail so that the most vulnerable sections get direct monetary support from the state to preserve their (already precarious) standards of living. Now is not the time to bother about deficits or be afraid of rating downgrades. What India needs is a much larger economic stimulus that would put more money in the hands of the people. They argue that this would lead to economic recovery by stimulating demand. Considering that the collapse of income for large sections directly affects business and industry, there is considerable merit to the idea of a stimulus on the demand side. However, the Indian government has been relatively cautious so far, perhaps conscious of its stretched fiscal position, and the fear that a ratings downgrade that will likely follow from elevated fiscal deficits would have long term negative consequences for the Indian economy, such as the flight of capital, not to mention the high inflation stoked by a high fiscal deficit. Moreover, the experience of how India dealt with the global financial crisis of 2008-09 is still fresh in our minds. On that occasion, the fiscal tap was turned on and the government largely succeeded in cushioning the economy from the impact of global meltdown. However, the failure to unwind, to get out of the stimulus mode in time, also set the economy up for high inflation and the currency crisis of 2013 when the rupee depreciated by close to 50 per cent in a matter of months. At the same time, there are a few measures specific to the financial services sector which the policymakers can consider and which won’t cost even a rupee. There’s no doubt that India’s banks and NBFCs will see their asset quality deteriorate, especially after August (when the extended moratorium ends) and this will be true for corporates, SMEs and even the retail segments. It is worth noting that over the last few years, at least among retail borrowers, there has been a marked improvement in credit culture. People are much more conscious of the need to maintain their credit scores and instances of wilful default are fewer in the retail segment. A moratorium, in this context, is not an advisable solution as it is costly and destroys the hard-earned credit culture. A better way would be to permit a one-time restructuring of loans that would conserve capital and allow borrowers to rebuild their income generation capability. Policymakers should encourage asset-backed lending and appreciate that there is little point in tying up lenders in cumbersome regulations and then expect credit growth to pick up. For example, an NBFC can give out unsecured loans without restrictions but a loan against gold jewellery is legally capped at 75% of the value of the gold (an asset liquid as cash and which does not depreciate). These rules were last revised by RBI in 2014 and it is time for a fresh look. Similarly, restoration of priority sector lending (PSL) status to eligible gold loans disbursed by NBFCs making them on par with the banks would be another welcome step. Nearly 30% of the Banking Sector’s Agriculture Loan book is in the form of gold loans. There is a need to remove this regulatory arbitrage between banks and non-banks for gold loan. After all, banks already enjoy get the benefit of lower capital charge on their gold loan book, and they face no restrictions in opening branches. Further, they enjoy the PSL benefit on a large part of their gold loan book classified under agricultural lending. In times of economic uncertainty and stress in the financial sector, there is an understandable hesitation to lend on the part of banks and NBFCs alike. Even borrowers tend to hold back as they are not sure if their venture would succeed given the prevailing economic uncertainty. In such times, lending against gold jewellery is a very good business to be in. The two major tailwinds for gold loans are the lifetime high gold prices and the heightened risk aversion of banks and NBFCs. That is why a lot of banks and NBFCs are planning to get into the gold loan business. After every crisis, there is shakeout and consolidation. Over the next few quarters and the next few years, I expect to see a lot more of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) happening in the financial space, and I won’t be surprised if the weaker players get weeded out. Now that the RBI has been made the sole regulator of the financial sector including Co-Operative Banks, all three major lending institutions (Banks, NBFCs/HFCs, and Co-Operative Banks) have come under the supervision of a single regulator. I expect harmonisation of many regulations thereby wiping out the regulatory arbitrage enjoyed by a few. With the blurring of boundaries, weaker players would have to go out of business or be taken over by larger entities. It will cause some pain in the short term but, over the longer term, it will be better for everyone. Published in Unique Times Magazine, August 2020(V.P.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Wishful thinking and fulfilling wishes July 23, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share From a single-room office at a small coastal fishing village in Kerala to a much-acclaimed Non-Banking Finance Company with branches spread all over India, the journey was never a cakewalk. There were moments of hesitation, and many challenges and setbacks that lurked at every turn. In marching ahead undeterred, lay the wise option. Getting off your comfort zone is probably the hardest part of it all. When you are well set with a good job in a bank, drawing a decent salary, the motivation to give it up and test your feet in uncharted waters is never there. On the one hand, there was a well-established and reputed business of pawn broking and money lending run by his father. On the other hand, there was a secure and permanent job with all its benefits. Making the decision that he should give up his cushy job to take-over the family business was an unexpected turn of events, but it proved to be the best decision ever. When Shri. V.P. Nandakumar took charge of the business after his father passed away, the prime challenge was to keep intact the credibility established by his father’s fair and transparent dealings. It was natural for people to be apprehensive about the new person in charge. Initially, people were reluctant to bestow the same trust to the successor as they did to his father. But it was all to change very soon. Being straightforward and forthright in his dealings, the apprehensions of the people were soon dispelled and gradually it gave to trust. With people from even distant locations turning up to place their hard-earned money, deposits started to pour in. The journey of the inheritor of the Manappuram legacy had begun. Manappuram Finance Ltd. was incorporated in 1992 but listing the company on the stock exchange was still a distant dream as the required capital appeared beyond reach. And yet, the desire to explore new horizons grew stronger. At a time when few were familiar with what the term "listing" implied, self-help turned out to be the best help. Thanks to the goodwill earned over the years, and the trust the local people had in the Manappuram brand, the required capital could be raised without too much of sweat. And then, Manappuram Finance Limited became one of the first NBFCs from Kerala to get its shares listed on the prestigious Bombay Stock Exchange in 1995. A journey that originally began with two employees and now employing more than 28,000 people, has not been without its ups and downs. But looking back, it was worth every step of the way and the cause of much satisfaction to Shri Nandakumar. In particular, what distinguishes Manappuram from other success stories is that its success facilitated tremendous wealth creation for many ordinary people around him. These were the folks who trusted him and invested their savings in the company’s equity shares in those early days. The journey has not always been a bed of roses. But the challenges were met firmly and turned into opportunities. Today, the challenge of COVID-19 is unlike anything that we've seen before, but he is determined to take it head-on and move ahead resolutely. Watch the interview with Shri V.P.

Investing in Gold and options for the retail investor | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Investing in Gold and options for the retail investor July 09, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share Investing in Gold and options for the retail investor By V.P. Nandakumar Whenever the price of gold goes up, the personal finance columns published in various newspapers and periodicals see hectic discussions about how much money an investor should set apart for investing in gold. However, during periods when the price of gold is stable or showing weakness, these very columns tend to be either silent about gold or go the other way and recommend against holding gold in the portfolio. But now that gold price in India is ruling at historic highs, there is a broad consensus that gold should always be a part of our investment portfolio, with a decent share of our total budget (anywhere from 10 to 20 percent) earmarked for the yellow metal. It is therefore time to look at what makes gold an enduring investment and also examine the various avenues available to retail investors who wish to add gold to their portfolio. Gold was historically used as a currency. When paper money came into the picture, it was initially backed by gold to inspire confidence. Gold holds the characteristics of a currency, a financial asset and also has quasi-foreign exchange attributes. After the US came off the gold standard in 1971, there is currently no other national currency in the world backed by gold. With the rise of paper currency, governments acquired great power to print currency at will. It is said that with great power comes great responsibility. However, the record shows that governments around the world have too often shirked the responsibility to exercise this power with due care. And whenever this power was misused, it set off inflationary spirals in the economy, which acted as a check on the power of governments to issue or print currency at will. Gold is also a rare commodity which ensures its continuing appeal. Every year, fresh mining of gold adds only about 2,500 to 3,000 tonnes to the supply. According to the World Gold Council, the total amount of gold mined over the ages would be around 190,000 tonnes of which India is estimated to hold as much as 35,000 tonnes, and that is nearly 20% of al the global gold ever mined! This should be viewed against India’s share in land area at 2.4%, in population at 17%, and in GDP at 3.9%. Moreover, India’s share in global gold demand is about 22% a year (average annual net gold import of 800 tonnes) against a share of 2% in world trade. Gold during an Economic Crisis During the great financial crisis of 2008-09, restraint in the matter of currency printing was given up by central banks in the advanced countries in the interest of stabilizing their economies. With all the extra money injected into the economy, interest rates fell while asset prices have increased sharply. Gold, in particular, was a major beneficiary, it’s price touching a peak of USD 1,900 per troy ounce in Aug 2011. In the current economic crisis induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the price of gold has once again risen sharply and now looks set to pierce the USD 1800 level. In India, with the Rupee having depreciated from levels of 45 to the dollar in Aug 2011 to about 75 rupees to the dollar nowadays, domestic gold prices are at historic highs, nearly Rs. 5,000 per gram (24K gold). In the current economic crisis also, US Federal Reserve is pumping in a lot of money, and this will certainly shore up the value of gold, which is priced in USD. Besides, Gold invariably performs well during times of economic stress as it is a natural safe-haven asset. Add to this, the sheer amount of liquidity being injected into the system has resulted in interest rates falling in western economies (and Japan) to near zero and even negative levels. This further increases demand for gold as the opportunity cost of holding gold (foregoing the interest which could have been earned by parking the money as a bank deposit) becomes insignificant. Moreover, the demand for gold has been resilient across economic cycles. When the economy is doing well, people spend more on discretionary purchases such as jewellery and technological devices, which increases the demand for gold. When the economy is down, confidence in the country’s financial system and currency weakens and investors seek reliable, liquid assets to protect their capital. This increases the demand for gold and thus its price. Gold and the Indian consumerIn order to reduce portfolio risk, it is important to diversify one’s investments. Gold has a negative correlation with equities and this helps in diversifying the portfolio in a convenient way. Whenever the equity side of the portfolio goes through a bearish phase, the notional loss on the same can be offset to an extent by the gold side. Almost every Indian household owns gold in some quantity or other. With our banking system lacking reach, particularly in rural areas, households use gold jewellery as a saving mechanism. Farmers purchase jewellery post-harvest and used them to raise funds for seeds and fertiliser in the next season. The economics was simple; buy gold when you have a surplus, and sell or pledge the gold when you need cash. Physical gold is still the most common form of investment in gold. The advantage is, you can keep it with you, you can touch it, and you can always take it out to admire its lustre and beauty. It is as real as it gets. Within physical gold, jewellery is the most preferred route but this incurs a higher cost by way of making charges. However, gold jewellery is not only an investment, it also amounts to “consumption” as when when you choose to wear it. In this aspect, it is similar to investing in a residential property, which allows you to live in it (consumption) and which is also likely to appreciate in value over time (investment). Gold in bullion form has a lower component of “making charges”, hence it is cheaper to acquire than jewellery. Bullion also fetches a better price in a sale as it can be easily valued and assayed, without much of wastage. Unlike investment in real estate which requires a bigger outlay of money, or equities which require paperwork and a high-risk appetite, investing in gold is easier and does not need large sums of money to get started. Other forms of holding gold Gold can also be bought through financial instruments or paper gold, such as gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), sovereign gold bonds, gold mutual funds etc. Investing in gold ETFs is cost-efficient as it does not incur ‘making charges’, storage concerns, and security and liquidity risks are not there. In fact, their selling points are low initial cost, high liquidity, no risk of loss on account of theft and spurious gold, and lower taxation. At the same time, there are some costs associated with gold ETFs such as expense ratio or management fees (usually 1%), brokerage, and trading costs. The more experienced investors who wish to leverage their exposure to gold may opt for futures and options on gold. However, this route is not advisable for retail investors lacking the technical knowledge to manage the risks involved in such trades. Sovereign Gold Bonds are another form of paper golds which the government issues, every two or three months for a week. On redemption, sovereign gold bonds do not attract tax, while physical gold attracts a tax of 20 per cent after applying indexation. These bonds also pay interest at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum payable semi-annually. To conclude, while gold has always merited a place in one’s investment portfolio, recent innovations have given rise to different forms of paper gold which can offer some worthwhile advantages over investing in physical gold such as greater liquidity, lower risk, the option to earn interest etc. As Dr. Y V Reddy, former Governor of the RBI, once noted, there is a lot more to gold than its colour and its attributes of providing safety, security and, under difficult circumstances, even liquidity.

The curious case of growth in gold loans as redemptions spiked | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The curious case of growth in gold loans as redemptions spiked June 12, 2020NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarSoon after the first phase of the lockdown was over and NBFCs were allowed to resume operations at their branches, there was much interest in the financial media about how gold loans would hold up in the current scenario where economic activity is at a low and GDP growth is heading into negative territory.The expectation was that the demand for gold loans would surge in keeping with the wider observation that most lenders in India have become risk averse and were focused on reducing their exposure to vulnerable customers. This is, of course, the direct outcome of the nationwide lockdown which effectively shut down the economy and which was aggravated by the RBI’s moratorium package, which led to a flight to safety among banks and NBFCs alike. Consequently, small borrowers and businesses were being starved for want of debt capital, be it to restart operations, or pay wages. Their working capital cycle was stretched to breaking points.Amidst this widespread risk aversion, only the gold lenders stood firm and kept their doors open for everyone. Even during the lockdown, when most lenders had stopped lending, gold loan companies were disbursing fresh loans through digital modes. Safety, or worries about likely defaults, is not an issue for the gold loan companies as the gold collateral (i.e. the jewellery pledged by borrowers) is held in the custody of the lenders and can be easily liquidated in the event of default. After the lockdown restrictions were relaxed in mid-April, NBFCs were able to reopen most of their branches, giving customers the opportunity to borrow afresh or close their existing loans and take the jewellery back. With other lenders turning shy and with gold prices climbing to historic highs, the expectation was that gold loans would take off, if not from new borrowers, then at least from existing borrowers who could choose to renew their pledges at the higher loan to value (LTV) ratio prevailing now.However, over the next one and half months till the end of May, most gold financiers saw a decline in their holdings of gold collateral in the range of 2 to 5 percent from March levels, as there was a rush of people looking to settle their loans and take back the jewellery. At the same time, the overall gold loan portfolio showed an increase, as the redemptions were more than offset by borrowers availing fresh loans at higher LTV (where the loan amount increases without needing more gold for pledge). And this brings us to something of a puzzle, why there should be a decline in collateral tonnage, even as demand for gold loans is high?In trying to answer this question, let’s try and get a sense of who the gold loan customers typically are and the reasons why they borrow against their family jewellery.To begin with, these customers are overwhelmingly those who do not have ready access to credit from the institutional lenders. Afterall, most of them don’t earn salaries, and they are unlikely to have proof of a regular income. Such would be the case with small time vendors and shopkeepers, the self-employed tradesmen etc. Secondly, their requirement of money would be urgent although they need the money only for a short period, say, to offset a temporary mismatch in cash flows. Some may borrow for just a few days or a few weeks. In fact, there are vendors who may borrow the money in the morning to purchase goods, sell them over the course of the day, then repay or close their loan by end of day to take back the jewellery the same day. The availability of such a unique short-term loan ensures their livelihood.At the same time, there is always a choice between selling the jewellery as scrap or borrowing against it. Which of these options gets picked would depend on the proposed use to which the money is to be put to. If it is meant for an income generating activity, chances are they would prefer to borrow.However, when faced with a severe downturn in business where there is no sight of a revival anytime soon, their stress levels go up and they may resort to the sale of their gold jewellery. This trend becomes stronger at times of high gold prices, such as now. The lockdown would have disrupted their daily routine of borrowing, trading and repayment and dented their confidence in their own ability to generate a profit good enough to repay a loan. At this point, they may prefer to sell their jewellery to raise funds because a loan would fetch them only 75 percent of the gold value, whereas a scrap sale would likely fetch them full value for the bullion content of the jewellery (though not for the making charges or the taxes paid). In fact, we have been hearing reports about customers coming to the branch accompanied by scrap dealers who fund the repayment and then acquire the jewellery from the borrower. This is one side of the picture.On the other side, with gold prices in India ruling at historic highs, a customer today stands to get a higher loan amount that what he would have likely paid to acquire the jewellery. As all the other sources of loans run dry, a gold loan becomes the natural fall-back option. It gives them access to the capital needed to re-start their businesses, leading to growth in the overall asset size of the gold financiers. These two aspects, seemingly contradictory, may now be seen as two sides of the same coin.Published in Unique Times Magazine, June 2020(V.P. Nandakumar is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. COVID-19: Light at the end of the tunnel May 30, 2020Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share By VP NandakumarA couple of months ago, in the March issue, I had written about COVID-19, even as it was in the early stages, highlighting the need for a coordinated global response. That was when total worldwide cases stood below 100,000 whereas it stands at over 3.8 million now, after having caused over 265,000 deaths. The disease has moved from China to Iran, Italy, South Korea, Spain, France, US and so on, to almost every inhabited part of the world. The worldwide lockdowns necessitated by the need to contain its spread have brought trade and travel to a grinding halt.The economic costs have been enormous and may well exceed the havoc wrought by the global financial crisis of 2008-09. One of the benchmarks for crude oil prices, West Texas Intermediate or WTI, slipped briefly into negative territory (implying that sellers would pay buyers!) something unimaginable in normal times. Gold prices are rising almost every day and look set to surpass the previous peak set in 2011. Unemployment and Job losses have spared no sector and geography and things have never looked gloomier than this.But then, it is said that the night is darkest before the dawn and there is reason for hope as well. Hospitals in Wuhan are not reporting new cases anymore and the city reopened on 8 April after a 76-day lockdown. Children in Spain were recently allowed outside for the first time in six weeks. In India, which went into a nationwide lockdown on March 24, most parts are limping back to normal, even as the red zones stay largely closed. At the time of announcing the lockdown, the Prime Minister had said, “jaan hai to jahan hai” (there is a world because there is life). By realising the gravity of the problem and taking harsh measures early on to contain the spread of the disease, India has successfully achieved its target of flattening the curve. Of course, it is too early to celebrate, but there is no denying that we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.The next battleThe time has come for us to gird ourselves for the next battle which will be bigger and longer lasting than the disease itself. This has to do with combating the economic fallout of the lockdown which has seen millions of Indian families lose their livelihood and pushed to the edge. For them, it is not so much about “revival of the economy” as a question of survival.Most Indian households earn their livelihood in the informal or unorganised segment. About 68 percent of the workers in non-agriculture and agriculture (except in growing crops) are engaged in the informal sector. Among regular wage/salaried employees in the non-agriculture sector, 71 per cent had no written job contract, 54 per cent were not eligible for paid leave, and 50 per cent were not eligible for any social security benefit. Majority of these workers do not have access to social security like provident fund, pension etc.More than 70 per cent of the Indian population lives in rural areas, and 52 percent of rural households are self-employed, while 25 percent depend on casual labour and 12 percent get regular wages and salaries. Only 9 percent of rural households are engaged in occupations such as officers and managers, professionals and technicians. Tough times for NBFCsThere’s no doubt that the economic fallout of the Corona pandemic represents a major challenge to NBFCs, who were already facing liquidity issues following the IL&FS default in late 2018. The imposition of the lockdown and the subsequent recommendation by RBI about extending a three-month moratorium to borrowers heightened concerns about prospects for the NBFC sector. However, by now, it is becoming clear that many borrowers have preferred to stick with their existing repayment schedule because they realise that the moratorium does not offer a waiver of interest or principal and would add to their interest outflow. Meanwhile, the operational disruption from the lockdown will be temporary but there can be serious long-term implications for asset quality as clients face job losses and declining incomes, impacting their capacity to service loans. A shakeout in the industry followed by consolidation looks imminent, and NBFCs who enjoy a strong capital buffer will be the survivors and beneficiaries. In the long run, a process of consolidation where weaker players are weeded out is beneficial for the industry.Gold loans will perhaps be the only lending business to come out of all this unscathed. It will also be the first to rebound when the lockdown eases. During periods of economic stress, banks are generally known to become risk averse and cut down on lending. Further, in today’s scenario, many NBFCs are faced with severe liquidity constraints and therefore in no position to pick up the slack. That would leave gold loans as the fall-back option for borrowers denied access to their regular channels. Indeed, the World Gold Council expects gold to become a tool for the revival of many small and medium enterprise businesses and household fortunes.In the microfinance segment, analysts expect much pain ahead for lenders as defaults are expected to surge. However, based on our past experience of dealing with episodes of stress in the segment, we are much more positive. Most microfinance borrowers are keen to maintain their account in good standing to avoid negative reporting to the credit bureaus and thus continue to be eligible for future loans. We saw this behaviour after the floods in Kerala and Chennai and the cyclone in Odisha. Recall also that the microfinance sector was laid low by Demonetisation but rebounded strongly thereafter. Further, within microfinance, companies with lower borrowing cost (who therefore charge lower rates of interest to their borrowers) are better placed as they would have attracted more credit-worthy customers by a process of natural selection.Critical to the health of the larger NBFC sector is the question, how quickly will the economy rebound after the lockdown is over? The incentive for borrowers to adhere to credit discipline and maintain repayments on schedule is much stronger when there is an end in sight to their pain. From this perspective, it will be worthwhile for the government to pump prime the economy with a large stimulus which can be unwound as and when growth picks up. Otherwise, a mood of pessimism and despondency may take over which can become self-reinforcing, in other words, something of a vicious cycle.Published in Unique Times Magazine, May 2020 (VP Nandakumar is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.

NandakumarIt was from Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China's Hubei province, that the WHO Country Office in China got its first report that pneumonia of an unknown cause had been detected. Later, on January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international concern. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has affected over 90,000 people the world over to become a global emergency.The epicentre of the outbreak is in China with the province of Hubei and eastern China the worst affected. The Chinese government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province to quarantine the epicentre of the outbreak of coronavirus disease. Economic activity and movement of people in these parts have come to a grinding halt.There were 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China itself, resulting in the death of nearly 3,000.

Why the need for collateral security in loans? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Why the need for collateral security in loans? February 12, 2020Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarA question that banks and NBFCs (or others in the business of lending money) often get asked is, why do they require collateral? In the context of finance, collateral is a property or any other asset that a borrower offers to the lender to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan repayments, the lender can take possession of, and sell off, the collateral to make good the losses.Collateral serves two primary purposes. The first is to act as a deterrent to the borrower against defaulting on his promised repayments (i.e. deterrent value). The second is to help the lender with the recovery of the dues (i.e. recovery value).In real life, it often happens that the recovery value of the collateral is less than its deterrent value. The difference, i.e. deterrent value – recovery value, is the “margin buffer” or the extra comfort a lender gets. The higher the difference, the higher the buffer, as the loan amount is mostly lower than the recovery value of the collateral. Of course, in some cases, the actual recovery amount could turn out to be less than the collateral’s assessed recovery value. Such variances can arise either due to faulty assessment or changes in market conditions.Accordingly, lenders aim to have a larger “margin buffer” to serve as a cushion in such a scenario. For example, if a customer borrows against gold jewellery, the resale value of the jewellery (or the value of its gold content) is the recovery value. However, the deterrent value is much more and would be the sum of the recovery value, the making charges paid to the jeweller, the taxes paid to the government, the retailer’s margin, and also the emotional connect or attachment the borrower and his family would have towards that piece of family gold jewellery.In this case, the buyer would have paid much more than the value of the gold metal constituting the jewellery, and it adds to the lender’s buffer. Likewise, a piece of jewellery which attracts higher making charges would provide a better margin buffer, and if the emotional value of the jewellery is higher (e.g. with a mangal sutra or jewellery in the nature of family heirloom etc.), it adds even more to the buffer.It is important to understand the “deterrent value” of the collateral from the customer’s perspective. If he were to default on his loan when the deterrent value is significantly higher than the recovery value, which in turn is more than the loan outstanding (including interest), then the customer is likely to make all-out efforts to keep the loan in order. Here, the Deterrent Value > Recovery Value > Loan Outstanding and this implies “margin buffer.” This deterrent value is the reason why a borrower may choose to default on one loan, and yet keep on servicing another loan.Indeed, there are several forms in which this kind of “deterrent value” becomes available to the lender. It is present not only in collateralised debts but also in cases of unsecured debt, such as in the form of a “personal guarantee” executed in favour of the lender, credit bureau scores that would suffer downgrade in the event of default (making it more difficult to avail loans in future), or the recourse to legal proceedings with all the hassles it entails for the borrower. Besides, the fear of loss of social standing also acts as a deterrent. Some lenders even choose to name and shame the borrower into nudging them towards honouring their obligations.When it comes to a personal guarantee, a personal guarantee from the borrower’s spouse may have more substantial deterrent value than one from the borrower. In the event of default, the lender could enforce the spouse’s guarantee, which borrowers would like to avoid at all costs. Similarly, lenders derive higher deterrent value from a residential property self-occupied by the borrower and family, rather than from a vacant house or one that is given out on rent.To sum up, the thumb rule is, the higher the buffer, the lower the likelihood of default. The borrower not only loses the collateral (recovery value) but also incurs an opportunity cost (deterrent value) over and above the recovery value of the collateral. For lenders then, the lesson is that they can effectively reduce the default rates, or NPAs, by maximising the deterrent value.Published in Unique Times Magazine, February 2020 (V.P.

After a dream run in 2019, gold prices likely to pause for breath | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. After a dream run in 2019, gold prices likely to pause for breath January 08, 2020Work ShopsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. NandakumarFor all the scientific and technological progress the world has made, people continue to value gold for the feeling of safety and security that it provides. Even today, most retail buyers of gold would trust it more than the currencies of their home countries. In fact, 75% of retail investors in India trust gold more than the rupee.[1] In the last calendar year, the price of gold in India has risen 23.9%[2] against a backdrop of falling interest rates, economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The international price of gold went up by 18.9%. Typically, a bull market in gold develops during times of global currency crises, a bull market in bonds (i.e[RS1] [SJ2] . falling interest rates), a commodities bull market, or a combination of all three.The weak growth outlook for global economies has helped boost gold prices. Also, the reduction in interest rates effected by the US Federal Reserve and other advanced economies, and gold purchases by central banks in the emerging market economies, have also helped support gold prices. Recently, the Asian Development Bank lowered the growth forecast for China and other major Asian economies including India. Notably, China and India are among the two largest consumers of gold in the world. At the same time, recent reports suggest that the ongoing US vs. China trade war may ease somewhat as the US has approved the phase[RS3] -one of the trade deal, which could reduce the uncertainty around global trade policies. The US has reportedly agreed to halve the tariffs on products worth $110 billion from 15% to 7.5%. Should this lead to optimism and a fresh wave of global risk-on trade, it can potentially weigh down on traditional safe-haven assets, including gold. However, sensitive issues such as indirect state subsidies, intellectual property and the Chinese ambition to dominate tech markets remain unresolved. Further, the upcoming 2020 presidential election is another uncertainty factor impacting policy risk. US Fed’s balance sheet expansion In December 2019, the US Federal Reserve Bank announced new term operations totalling $365 billion (over the two months upto January 2020), which involves ramping up the amount of temporary liquidity injections into the overnight lending markets. The Fed is to offer a total of $490 billion in liquidity via repo operations, including the $75 billion that it has already pumped in through three earlier term actions.Historically, the Fed’s balance sheet expansion programs have boded well for gold. For instance, the initial expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet began in 2009 in response to the sub-prime crisis. At that time, the Fed’s balance sheet was below $1 trillion, but by 2014, it had increased to $4.5 trillion. From 2008 to 2011, the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt, sending gold prices to a record high. In fact, during this period, gold rose from $800 per ounce to $1,200, and peaked at a record high of $1,921 in September 2011. Note that prices fell from highs above $1,600 to $1,200 in the first six months of 2013 due to expectations that the US Fed would unwind its policy of monetary easing (the so called “taper tantrum”). All in all, there is a strong reason to anticipate a near term bullish move in gold on the back of Fed’s balance sheet expansion.[Gold Is New Obsession for East Europe’s Nationalist Leaders] Pricing of Gold In some respects, gold is somewhat[RS4] like a super-sovereign, zero-coupon bond. It has an intrinsic value, and it is highly liquid, carries no risk of default and provides no yield. As such, the returns generated by gold depend on its underlying value rising over time. Much like bonds, the price rises as yields fall, a trend that was particularly evident during the two big US debt crises of the past 100 years, the Great Depression in 1929 and the Subprime Crisis in 2008. The US authorities dealt with both crises in a similar fashion: they reduced short-term interest rates to around zero, thereby injecting liquidity into the financial system and depreciating the dollar against major currencies. Gold benefited from this policy on two counts. Firstly, as gold is priced and traded primarily in dollars, its purchasing power increased as the US currency weakened. Secondly, as interest rates fall, bond yields fell in sync. All this effectively reduces the opportunity cost of investing in gold which is a non-income-bearing asset. To understand the relationship between the price of gold in US dollars and the US interest rate and inflation, one can think of gold as if it were a bond. Gold, in this sense, is like a zero-coupon bond (pays no interest), long duration (lasts forever), inflation-linked (demonstrated by historical purchasing power) and has zero credit risk (like a super-sovereign). Charlie Morris, Head of Multi-Asset Atlantic House Fund Management created a gold valuation model[3], to value gold in US dollars, as a model of a hypothetical zero-coupon inflation-adjusted asset: The number 4 is the calibration with the best fit using a regression model, and the 20-year duration derives from a volatility match. Gold’s long-term average volatility has been similar to 20-year US Treasuries. It is more volatile than the 10-year but less so than the 30-year. He overlaid the results of this calculation on top of the gold price and it seemed to explain the trend, fair value and medium-term movements. Forecasts for Gold Price The US Fed has cut short-term interest rates and most observers expect further reduction. There is even speculation in some quarters about more quantitative easing which would provoke another round of dollar depreciation. Bullion climbed to a six-year high in September 2019 as the Federal Reserve cut borrowing costs and the total pile of debt yielding less than zero rose to a record $17 trillion, boosting the appeal of non-interest-bearing gold. The question may now be asked, what is the outlook for gold in 2020? Here are the views of some important players in the market. Citigroup believes that gold has got more room to rally as there’s little possibility of the Fed raising interest rates in 2020. With the risks to global growth tilted to the downside, with inflation still undershooting, and with trade tensions likely to persist through 2020, they believe the bar to cut rates and going back to policy easing is lower. Citigroup expects Gold Futures to average about $1,575 an ounce in 2020, with an upside bias. They do not expect the US policy rate to move higher, rather, the Fed is seen capping the rise in real as well as nominal medium-term yields, thereby reducing the opportunity costs of holding gold. All these factors should be supportive of gold price in the medium term. The most significant risk to gold prices in the near term is a surprise trade deal between the U.S and China and a substantial rollback of tariffs. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG see prices climbing to $1,600 an ounce (a level last seen in 2013). Gold is likely to have specific periods of outperformance when the market goes risk-off (i.e. when negative sentiments dominate and inhibit risk-taking). While most see a prolonged pause from the Fed, there are dissenters too. BNP Paribas SA expects another two rate cuts in the first half of 2020. The low-yield environment, along with the anticipated weakening of the dollar and easy money policies, will continue to support gold. Bullion buying by governments has emerged as a major pillar of demand, and this includes purchases by China. Goldman Sachs says the case for diversifying into Gold is ‘as strong as ever’ as central banks are consuming a fifth of the global supply of gold, marking a shift away from the dollar that’s bolstering the case for owning bullion. Demand for gold from central banks is the highest since the Nixon era (i.e. early seventies). Investors are therefore being advised to diversify their long-term bond holdings by including gold because of “fear-driven demand” for the metal. BNP Paribas SA expects gold to surge above $1,600 an ounce as the Fed embarks on a quartet of interest rate cuts to combat slowing U.S. growth, the fallout from the trade war with China, and diminished prospects for any significant pick-up in inflation in the coming months. It expects the US Fed to opt for four 25 basis point cuts between now and June 2020. As nominal yields fall with each reduction, real rates will head towards negative territory, increasing the appeal of holding gold. On the other side, Morgan Stanley believes that a rollback in the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China against each other could see gold prices falling[RS5] toward their bear case forecast of $1,394 an ounce in the first half of 2020. Further, Chinese consumers are shunning gold as they grapple with the slowest economic growth since the early 1990s. China’s imports of non-monetary gold in October 2019 slumped to the lowest level since January 2017. Demand in India is also relatively depressed, and was unusually weak during the Diwali festival that otherwise sees a bump in imports. Accordingly, there is little reason to expect a rebound in consumer demand for gold anytime soon, and should investment demand begin to wane too, the continuation of the gold bull run will be at risk. To sum up, there is no way one can confidently predict what the price of gold would be in 2020. Analysts can, at best, try and predict the likely reaction of gold price in case specific events occurs. There is no denying that the global economy is yet to recover fully from the financial crisis of 2008-09. While the US is showing signs of strength, Brexit can possibly set off fresh tremors across global markets. The yield on more than one-third of global debt is in negative territory. The trade war is far from over, and with US presidential elections in November 2020, there is more uncertainty to come. In a nutshell, while gold prices may see some easing in 2020, a sharp correction is less than likely. Moreover, there are several known unknowns that may nudge markets towards risk-off leading to the continuation of the gold bull run. At the end of the day, however, your guess is as good as mine.

5 steps to get “retirement ready | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. 5 steps to get “retirement ready July 01, 2019NewsManappuram Finance Share Our parents took care of their parents in old age, probably we would take care of our parents too. Would our children take care of you as well? If your answer is YES, then you need not read further. However, if your answer isn’t a resounding YES, then you have work to do.While saving for retirement may not be at the forefront of your mind, it should be, no matter how old you are or where you are in your career. Even if you have Rs. ZERO saved, now is the perfect time to begin stowing away money for you financially secure retirement.Do I have enough to retireIn general, humans tend to do nothing unless prompted. The hardest action is also the most effective one —save more. The more you save, the earlier you start, the more you’ll have when you retire. Whether you seek out a financial planner or use GOOGLE, the idea is the same: Start saving something. Rather than trying to get it right, keep it simple and get started. Questions as how much to save, where to save come later. The idea is the “progress”, not the “perfection”. There is no perfect retirement plan, however, these 5 steps would ensure your progress towards a financially secure retirement.1. Start Saving — no excusesThe most important step in saving for retirement is starting. Many of us, who want to retire as millionaires have no idea how to get there, and others never get started saving because “one must have the perfect plan right from the start”. Let’s get this straight, there is no perfect plan! Progress towards successful retirement is to start saving some. Something is better than nothing, but nothing is better than absurd. So, start saving and invest your savings as per your risk appetite and risk-adjusted return. If you are in the early stages of your career you can take more risk (via equity investment), if you are closer to your retirement, you should emphasize more on the safety of your investments. Retirement nest must have different colors of eggs, under no circumstances put all your eggs in one basket!2. Set periodic goals, not a random numberAlthough you may strive to save up a crore for retirement, set smaller, regular goals, not a random final amount. While there is no one number one should have saved when we retire, it is important to set a target, so you know if you’re headed in the right direction. For instance, set the goal to have ‘x’ amount saved by age 'y.'Rule of thumb says you could withdraw 6% from your golden nest (retirement fund) every year for it to last your lifetime. Lower the withdrawal rate longer the nest will last.The first step is to determine a savings goal, based on your intended retirement lifestyle and the number of years you expect to live in retirement (subtract your age from 85). Make sure to take the lifestyle changes of retirement into consideration. For example, your transportation costs might decrease, since you’ll no longer be commuting to work, but the cost of utilities might go up as you will be spending more time at home. Your tourism expenses could rise, if you plan to travel through your retirement, going to places you always wanted to. Your healthcare cost would be higher although you may not have to financially support your kids.Rule of thumb, 60%-80% of your current expenses would suffice. Effectively one should aim for 20X of your expenses in the nest, closer to the target, lower the adjustments required post-retirement.3. Balance paying off debt with saving for retirementWhile you may want to set aside as much as you can for retirement, you still need to take care of present financial needs, like paying off debts. However, there’s a caveat to this. While it may sound counterintuitive, aggressively save for retirement rather than racing to pay off loan debt. The tax breaks and compound interest that retirement contributions offer is worth far more than the interest saved by accelerated loan repayment.Caveat: Housing & Education loans qualify for tax breaks. You must pay off your credit card dues, personal loan, auto loans etc.4. A Disciplined Investment ProcessRetirement investing should be a disciplined, integrated process:Plan your retirement and determine your prioritiesSelect asset allocations based on historical probabilities that can deliver the target returnInvest with low-cost funds; remember a penny saved is a penny earnedSaving as much money as you can, for as long as you can, is key.5. What to do with the saving / Where to investBelow are few investment options, everyone should utilize for the reasons of reasonable risk adjustment returns, some with additional tax benefits.Top off your EPF contributions (At least 12% of your salary, more the merrier). Investments up to 1,50,000/- year qualify your tax saving purposes under Sec. 80C of IT Act.Invest regularly in National Pension Scheme (Must to have Tier-1 account & good to have Tier 2 account). You may choose your fund manager and investment options (equity, corporate debt and government debt). Investment up to Rs. 50,000 every year in Tier-1 account of NPS, qualifies for additional tax saving under Sec. 80CCD of IT Act.Tier-2 acts like a low-cost Mutual Fund, you can choose to park your short-term surplus funds here, withdraw it as per the need.Open an account under Atal Pension Yojana, you could opt for monthly pension ranging from Rs. 1,000 – 5,000 by making monthly contributions directly from the bank.Note: Maximum entry age is 40 years.Get insured (Must have Term Life Insurance and Health Insurance). Term insurance tenure should cover your earning life only. No need to take term insurance until 80 years of age. It is insurance, not an investment. ULIP plans are not for insurance. Getting health insurance at later stages of life becomes difficult and costly, start early, choose the coverage as per your requirements post-retirement. Health insurance also qualifies for tax benefit under Sec. 80D of IT Act. Add-ons: Critical Illness Plan, Hospital Cash Benefit Plan and Accident Insurance, if you want more security over your health costs. Contribute fully to PPF account, the current limit of Rs. 1,50,000 per year. Invest in direct mutual fund plans, not through an agent/bank.A typical regular equity mutual fund is 1% more expensive than a direct plan. 1% every year of your wealth goes away at a compounding rate. Your wealth can easily get a boost of 20-30% if invested in directly. You may choose between equity/corporate debt/government debt plans as per your risk appetite.Even low-cost Equity ETF are also good investment options. If you want to invest in Gold, buy gold ETF/paper gold. Remember expense on Jewelry is consumption, not investment. You don’t want your investment to lose 10% just on investing! Unit Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs) qualify for tax advantages, additional cost associated with ULPIs make it a total NO-NO option.Once you have made your financial plan and invested with discipline, you can answer the “Do I have enough?” question with confidence. “Yes, I have enough!” If you’re asking the question, “Do I have enough to retire?” you probably need a financial plan.

Fast Growing Digital Adoption, Change in Customer Behaviour and Related Fraud Trends | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Fast Growing Digital Adoption, Change in Customer Behaviour and Related Fraud Trends June 19, 2019NewsManappuram Finance Share By Rajiv RathinamFast-growing Adoption of Smartphones and increased internet penetration has created an ecosystem that enables consumers to embrace digital technology across multiple areas of their life. One of the most embraced activities is shopping online for goods and services.Similarly, an area that is seeing a significant shift in consumer behavior is banking, the second most cited online activity among our survey participants. 86 percent of consumers, who have access to internet-enabled mobile or desktop devices, said they conduct personal banking online, with that number being higher in countries with a well-established digital banking environment, like Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore, as well as fast-growing countries like India. Despite the fast-growing adoption of digital channels, there are striking differences across the region in terms of digital readiness and capability. In emerging Asia- Pacific, government agencies and businesses are looking to improve the physical and regulatory infrastructure and availability of skilled talent and thus, tackle challenges surrounding financial inclusion, access to basic services and cyber-security. Traditional payments methods, such as cash-on-delivery, still dominate but change is underway. Security is the most important element of a consumer's online experience The rapid pace of digital adoption is largely driven by the millennial population and affluent members of society. As more consumers come online and establish new habits, businesses can benefit from the cost and reach advantages that digital services offer. Unlocking the benefits of new digital lifestyles will be rewarding for businesses and consumers, but is not without challenges.Consumers have higher than ever expectations, at the same time, digitally transforming service attract the risk of online fraud.50 percent of businesses surveyed in Asia-Pacific region have seen an increase in fraud losses over the past 12 months in the form of account misused account takeovers, both potentially damaging to the Organizations Brand and Reputation. In India the Frauds reported stood at 65 percent and Hong Kong Being the lowest 34 percent. Fraud is a major concern as the reputation damage from Fraud can put the existence of our business at stake.Government agencies and industry collaboration in Asia-Pacific are a driving force in making online activities more secure:In India, government agencies, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), are approaching consumer online security in a proactive manner. RBI has been diligently putting measures in place to ensure that digital transactions in India are protected, for example, by making two- factor authentication and static step-up authentication mandatory online protection measures. In addition, regulatory bodies in India have reprimanded large industry players in the past 12 months for unauthorized use of personal data, sending a message to Indian consumers that there is someone looking out for their online security and Protection.Sixty percent of consumers place a high level of trust in banks and insurance companies in handling their personal data, followed by government agencies (57 percent) and payment service providers. Trust in Banks and Insurance Companies are the Highest in India.Digital adoption and with it a fast-growing digital ecosystem are changing the relationship between businesses and consumers in Our Country. While businesses are striving to drive and unlock the benefits from increasingly digital lifestyles, they must tackle many challenges. Customers like to be recognized and expect to be met with a personalized experience at every interaction. At the same time, the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks including online fraud requires a matching response to guarantee the safety of personal data and safeguard businesses’ reputation.Faced with these challenges, what can businesses do to deliver both the security and convenience consumers expect?It may begin with a business’s ability to identify its customers and deliver relevant, convenient experiences without increasing their risk exposure by demanding more from the information it already accesses.Digital identity programs that create a “single source of truth” and provide businesses and government agencies with verified customer digital identities are key in balancing security and convenience for online transactions.Creating transparency regarding how businesses use their customers’ information and investing in the right technology for fraud management and safe customer authentication can go a long way toward creating more trust.As consumers feel strongly about how businesses use their personal data, businesses that are transparent and use the data to increase customer security and convenience can be particularly successful in establishing customer trust.Businesses have to start embracing advanced customer authentication methods, for example, those, that leverage biometric data, will fare well once consumers start to gain experience with them.OVERALL FRAUD TRENDS IN INDIAWhat does it take to build customer trust?

Increasing Role of HFCs in Funding the Unfunded | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Increasing Role of HFCs in Funding the Unfunded June 18, 2019Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share By Jeevan Das NarayanIndia is one of the world’s fastest growing economies, with the sixth largest GDP. Occupying a pride of place in the financial eco systems are the NBFCs and HFCs.Perhaps no sector has come under as much media attention and public glare in recent times as the housing finance sector. A close second would be the NBFC sector in general. It is a well-known fact that the sector started facing difficulties close on the heels of the IL & FS debacle and the ALM issues faced by a large HFC, triggering a liquidity tightening for the entire sector.Over the years, NBFC Sector has played a stellar role in driving credit disbursals in areas and segments of customers where banks were traditionally hesitant to venture into. It is reported that over the last 5 years or so, the NBFC lending book has grown by nearly 18%, mainly driven by a deep understanding of specific customer segments, lean cost structures and technology. Developments in technology and the advent of Fintech companies have also played a key role in fuelling the NBFC growth story in our country.Housing Finance Companies have always been an integral part of the NBFC eco system. But their importance started increasing in our economy in the last couple of years. Their advent was fuelled by the vision of “Housing for all by 2022” announced by the Government. Increasing incomes in the hands of the middle class, infrastructure development, opening up tier III & IV centres, larger and organized players moving into the affordablesegment, are the various factors which have contributed in no small measure to the growth of the market for affordable housing in our country. This, in turn has led to a number of smaller players and established business houses venturing into the segment with their housing finance subsidiaries. Implementation of RERA and concessions in GST for smaller dwelling units have further added to the charm of the sector.Several Housing Finance Companies have been waiting in the queue for license from NHB and this trend is expected to continue. New entrants are likely to face tough competition from the existing players. This combined with the liquidity tightening and the current slightly negative market perception on the sector, would make it extremely challenging for newer and smaller players in the near term.We, however, believe that this is just a passing phase like various business cycles witnessed from time to time. Players with deep understanding of the sector and customer segments, with robust risk mitigation measures in place will outlast others. As housing is the most fundamental of all human needs, the market for affordable housing will further expand beyond, even tier IV cities in the times to come. As banks have traditionally been funding only the salaried and the documented income segments, there is huge scope for HFCs to fund the unfunded and undocumented income segments of customers. On the supply side, several established players expected to enter the segment especially in tier III & IV cities is likely to increase the supply in such cities, adding to the supply from self-construction.We, at Manappuram Home Finance have been able to grow at a steady phase over the last couple of years since inception, as compared to many of our competitors under the able guidance and support of our parent company, Manappuram Finance Limited.Our strategy is to grow at a faster pace in the affordable housing segment keeping a firm eye on quality of the portfolio and adopting a low OPEX model.Technology will play a key part in our journey ahead. A comprehensive digitisation of the processes is what we are aiming at. The complexities involved in underwriting mortgage loans at various locations and states, under varying property dynamics and valuation matrix renders the task challenging but not insurmountable.A deep understanding of the Micro markets, various customer segments and adopting technology intensive processes with score card-based credit engine will help us in scaling up quality business. A strong risk & collection culture with an employee friendly work culture would be the right ingredients for our sustainable growth.To conclude, Governmental push in affordable housing sector combined with the regulatory tightening of the sector with higher capital requirements and lower leverage will definitely boost the prospects of the sector, attracting newer players and eliminating the marginal entities. With the expected improvement in the real estate sales velocity and liquidity in the market, the sector prospects are expected to significantly improve for serious players who take medium term view. We at ‘MAHOFIN’ are poised to grow our company on the desired lines adding value to all Stakeholders.(The writer is MD - Manappuram Home Finance Limited) Previous BlogFast Growing Digital Adoption, Change in Customer Behaviour and Related Fraud TrendsNext BlogRole of Microfinance in Financial InclusionPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

Role of Microfinance in Financial Inclusion | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Role of Microfinance in Financial Inclusion June 17, 2019Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share By S V Raja VaidyanathanFinancial inclusion is generally defined in terms of financial exclusion. In India, majority of the population belongs to lower income group. But the facilities which can be availed be it financial services or any other, generally targets the few rich people. Thereby the low-income group gets neglected. This is the kind of exclusion which needs to be highlighted by favoring the concept of Financial Inclusion.The great tragedy lies in the fact that sometimes even though there are certain financial services, specially designed to meet the needs of these people, they remain unaware about the same due to illiteracy or other reasons. Thus, lack of awareness also leads to the financial exclusion.Role of Microfinance: The main aim of financial inclusion is to make the financial services accessible to lower income group and that is where role of micro finance comes in. For the achievement of financial inclusion, the most important goal is to make the banking facilities available to all the unbanked areas and each household.Microfinance plays a very important role in financial inclusion in different ways such as: Micro credit is provided to poor women in remote areas who have income generating activities.There are various organizations providing micro credit with which they also conduct training for first time customers and impact their financial literacy and explain about the various microfinance products available to them. NBFC-MFIs play an important role in the government’s agenda of Financial Inclusion as they cater to the unbanked sections of Indian society under the regulatory oversight of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The Microfinance industry has witnessed impressive growth over the past five years, growing over the past five years, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 45 percent. It has evolved and matured with regulatory reforms following the Andhra Pradesh crisis (in 2010). Following regulatory reforms covering code of conduct, fair practices, pricing of loans we have seen the emergence of regulated NBFC MFIs, the formation of a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), and transformation of some MFIs into universal and small finance banks.With over 60 million end clients, a loan book of over Rs 1.50 lakh core, and employing over 1.2 lakh people across 10,000 plus branches, the microfinance sector has emerged as a formidable force for the spread of financial inclusion in India.Despite the growth, the industry caters to less than 25 percent of the demand and this indicates the potential for future growth. The outreach of MFI has been growing rapidly over the past few years due to low penetration of formal banking system, especially among lower income groups.The impact of demonetization has nudged the MFI sector to move towards cashless modes of operation. However, it is expected that a significant proportion of MFI transaction (mainly collections) would continue to be in cash due to small ticket size, and low penetration of smartphones among its low-income customer base. However, the fact today is that Technology and innovation have become key drivers of economic growthWe expect the industry to register a modest growth of 30 per cent.Asirvad, a subsidiary of Manappuram has been playing a significant role in the NBFC-MFI space. We have completed 11 years so far. Our growth strategy was very different initially. We always wanted to reach highest productivity in one territory before moving on to newer one.Soon after acquisition by Manappuram, the philosophy changed to mitigation of risk and hence the diversification strategy. With a neatly laid out plan and ample support from the parent, Asirvad soon spread its wings and as we speak has its footprint across 22 states and Union territories in India with a branch network close to 1000 branches. The company in its fold has 1.8 Million borrowers with a AUM of nearly 4000 Crores.The future looks more exciting for the company. With the support of Manappuram, Asirvad will certainly emerge as one of the top three in the Industry. By 2022 the AUM is sure to cross 10000 Crores.The journey has not been very smooth but it’s certainly satisfying given the fact that we put smiles across million women in India. With these small loans we help them to dream big.Asirvad is committed to be a long-term player in the Financial Inclusion space and will continue to play a vital role in supporting the Government in this endeavor.(The writer is MD - Asirvad Microfinance Limited) Previous BlogIncreasing Role of HFCs in Funding the UnfundedNext BlogEmphasis on Effective Market Penetration & Data Driven Decision MakingPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Emphasis on Effective Market Penetration & Data Driven Decision Making June 15, 2019Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share By K Senthil KumarManappuram Finance is one of India’s leading Gold Loan NBFC’s. We have experienced an immense history of unparalleled growth with many milestones achieved and our primary objective will always be to sustain and keep growing at a rapid pace. In the world of financing, with such arduous competition, continuously innovating, evolving and sustaining rapid growth are the key ingredients in establishing a significant hold in the credit lending market. As a pioneer and trailblazer, Manappuram Finance has always been an innovator par excellence that enabled it to lead the way and stay ahead in the game.Our plan is to make Commercial vehicle financing in India more inclusive as well as exclusive at the same time. We want to expand on our existing products and services to the optimum extent, create a sense of exclusiveness for every product we offer to our different range of customers. Our major objective is to make customers realize we have something different to offer to them at every stage. We tend to make our plans very dynamic so that we can adapt to the socioeconomic changes efficiently.Moreover, knowing the high level of competition already existing in this field, as we mentioned earlier, we would like to take lessons from our stories of unparalleled growth, generate more flexible, simpler and market capturing solutions and adapt to and implement effective product and technology innovations. We continuously explore various innovative approaches to raising finance; create further efficient solutions for customer on boarding and management through our services as well as maintain the growth and quality of our portfolio through several effective initiatives. For example, we are one of the first Commercial Vehicle financiers to use robust data analytics platforms on our internal as well as bureau database for evaluating customers through various behavioral and static scorecards. It is one of our firsts and hopefully we will keep building on such excellent initiatives and expand on our pool of solutions.Our mantra has always been to incorporate a robust growth outlook, expand on our established and synergistic products and leverage on our strong brand equity and customer base. This mantra combined with our team’s willpower and effective implementation has helped us realize our true potential and future goals.We already have a wide range of products on which we want to expand, have a deeper market penetration, both urban and rural. Knowing the potential of commercial vehicle financing market in our country and the rate at which it is growing, effective expansion and penetration is our key priority. Our focus will always be on empowering the unbanked segment, leveraging on the immense opportunities arising from the “last mile connectivity” segment through our expansive “hub and spoke model” and we are also looking forward to expand on our electric vehicles segment as well.We are now living in an era where data has been coined as the new oil and innovations based on data driven decision making is being termed as an inexhaustible engine for growth. In today’s financial service landscape, business is driven by data. Data provides valuable insights for businesses to focus on key areas that need valuable resources such as people and money. Currently, anything and everything that happens in a financial sector generates data; The key takeaway? Data is helping the individual manage his/her work easier. Early warning systems help him achieve milestones in the application process on time and ultimately result in speedy loan origination and enhanced customer satisfaction.Analytics can surely work as a refinery in generating efficient insights from the robust internal database and that gives you an edge over the others in foreseeing portfolio trends and taking decisions based on dynamic trends exhibited by our indigenous data. We have been currently utilizing our robust analytics platform to monitor and manage our customers from the point of on boarding, improving efficient collection mechanisms, predicting early delinquency scenarios and understanding various portfolio dynamics. Our goal is to move to automated decision making to a certain extent, since in the Commercial Vehicles industry, there exist a lot of externalities, it is never possible to have a fully automated data driven decision making. We have always efficiently adapted to technology and product innovations, so data driven decision making is another such innovation that we would like to utilize effectively in leveraging our opportunities.We would always like to keep innovating, differentiating and implementing and hopefully we can keep challenging ourselves like we always have in achieving our goals.

Why millennials should opt for gold loans to fund personal needs | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Why millennials should opt for gold loans to fund personal needs May 01, 2019NewsManappuram Finance Share It is no secret that India is a young country. Young Indians are making their mark across the globe in every field and making the country proud. Like with everything else, if there is one word that could be used to characterize this generation, it will be “Instant”.The instant generation or the millennials have been defined by experts across the globe. I shall not venture into that territory. My intervention today is to tell you how a product like Gold Loan, which has been associated with the poor and rural people is more suited to the instant and urban populace, we have come to recognize as the millennials.Traditionally, when the gold loan as the product was born it was a product for the poor. It gave them the liberty to monetize household gold deposits and offered instant cash in the direst of situations. However, as time has passed, fruits of economic progress have reached the interiors of our country. Farmers are now more educated and use the latest technology to carry out transactions for their day-to-day business needs. Gold loan product has also evolved and made itself future ready.The preferred mode of transaction of the millennial generation is the credit card or the e-wallet. Service providers are introducing even post-paid wallets in the market, which allow you to spend now and pay later. Credit cards as a product are designed to spur spending and encourage purchase through means such as EMI, discounts and cash back etc. So where does an eponymous Gold Loan fit in this picture?The primary utility of a gold loan for a millennial lies in its ability to bridge the cash flow mismatch where the due date may be before the salary day. In such cases, one could borrow against the jewelry to clear dues. Loan amounts can be as low as Rs 1000. Gold loans can be for any period of requirement and interest is paid only for the days' money is borrowed for, which makes it most convenient and instant.A gold loan is a stitch in time that saves exorbitant penalty charges levied by the card companies, it also helps to maintain a good credit score. A good credit score later comes in handy when one applies for a car loan or a home loan or even a personal loan. All financial institutions rely on a credit score to assess an individual’s creditworthiness and delayed payments are often the difference between a loan sanction and rejection.While one agrees that millennial may not have a big store of jewelry, whatever is available is usually kept at home or in lockers and rarely used. With mobile phones, and access to the internet available 24x7 gold loans can now be availed online with money transferred to account instantaneously. The Online Gold Loan or OGL as we call it at Manappuram also offers an overdraft as and when needed.The best part of this arrangement is that one does not have to travel to a branch every time. In fact, the gold loans are also available instantly just like the noodles. A customer can ask for a loan against gold, through text message, at their doorstep and even through a mobile app at the flick of their finger. Once the OGL account is opened they can withdraw money directly to their bank account to pay EMIs/ Credit card dues. Once the salary is received these accounts can be closed just as easily. In fact, with the overdraft facility, an OGL is a very attractive option of ready cash that can be retained since it does not have any restrictions on the number of times a customer wants to borrow or repay, there is no pre-payment penalty either.Thus far, the Gold loans have had what can be best described as an image problem. The traditional label of a product for rural and poor has stuck to them and the millennial audience have been wooed by the nimble products such as the wallets and cards. But as the times are changing, the gold loans are fast shedding their traditional tag and embracing the technology to appeal to the millennial user.Joshy V.K.National Head, Sales(This article was published in Financial Express Online on April12, 2019) Previous BlogEmphasis on Effective Market Penetration & Data Driven Decision MakingNext BlogDr. Manmohan Singh - Architect of India's rebirthPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

Dr. Manmohan Singh - Architect of India's rebirth | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Dr. Manmohan Singh - Architect of India's rebirth August 09, 2018NewsManappuram Finance Share On August 4, 2018, at the Constitution Club in New Delhi, Dr. Manmohan Singh, Hon’ble Former Prime Minister of India, will receive the first V.C. Padmanabhan Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award. The award will be presented to Dr. Singh by none other than Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Hon’ble Former President of India.We all know Dr. Manmohan Singh as the architect of India’s landmark economic reforms of 1991. He is an economist of international repute who came into politics and went on to scale the highest rungs of government. He took charge as Finance Minister in 1991 under Prime Minister Shri P.V. Narashimha Rao, at a time when the Indian economy was on the brink of collapse. The country was heading towards bankruptcy when Dr. Singh pressed ahead with radical reforms that would go on to reshape India’s destiny. Industrial output took off, jobs were created, and millions were pulled out of poverty. When we look back at what has been achieved since then, there is no doubt that the moment when Dr. Singh rose to deliver an impassioned speech to present the budget of 1991 is the moment that marks India’s rebirth.History will record India’s year of birth as 1947 but for millions of Indians, the true meaning of freedom could be realised only after 1991 when our masses could be freed from poverty and disease in greater measure than ever before. Many more could now look forward with hope for a better life for themselves and for their children.The bold reforms of 1991 were conceived by Dr Singh who went to the Prime Minister with the message that India needed difficult reforms to move forward. To the credit of the then Prime Minister, he supported Dr. Singh to the hilt. Thus began a difficult restructuring of the Indian economy when it was opened up to competition with a larger role for the private sector, and a diminished role for the government.The new industrial policy ended public sector monopoly in many sectors and opened the doors for foreign direct investment. The overvalued rupee was depreciated in two phases which gave a nudge to exports. Trade policy was liberalised by replacing quantitative restrictions with tariffs which were gradually lowered to open up the economy to competition. In 1990-91, the weighted average import tariff was 125 percent which was brought down to 71 percent within two years. With the support from International Monetary Fund (IMF), Dr Singh implemented major macroeconomic adjustments, a mix of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies meant to reduce internal and external imbalances. The government’s finances were brought under control and the unlimited monetisation of the fiscal deficit was ended. Economic conditions became conducive for entrepreneurship to flourish even as the government increased corporate tax from 40 to 45 percent to ensure funds to fulfil its social commitments.The results became apparent within a few years. Trade registered significant growth over pre-liberalisation period. The ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP doubled to 14 percent in 2000 from 7.3 in 1990. In the same period, the ratio of total goods and services trade to GDP increased from 17.2 percent to 30.6 percent.The economic reforms of 1991 provided a strong foundation for the economy to grow at a faster pace than ever before. In recent years, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing leading economies of the world. It has become possible only because of those far reaching reforms helmed by Dr. Singh while holding the position of Finance Minister.Today, I believe India owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Singh which can never be truly redeemed.And this award to Dr. Manmohan Singh is only a humble gesture of recognition of a man who has made a lasting difference to our lives. We consider ourselves truly fortunate that the first recipient of the V.C. Padmanabhan Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement is also one of India’s tallest sons.(V.P.

The rise and risks of passive investing | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. The rise and risks of passive investing June 10, 2018NewsManappuram Finance Share Up until the end of January 2018, stock markets around the world were scaling new heights and setting new records at regular intervals. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record when it closed at 26,616.71 on January 26, 2018. In India, the BSE Sensex set its own closing record at 36,283.25 on 29 January, 2018.However, beginning in February, the picture has turned adverse for the markets. In just two weeks, the Dow Jones industrials posted a steep fall of 3200 points or 12 percent down from the record highs reached a few days earlier on 26 January. Indeed, February 5 was called the scariest day on Wall Street in years with stocks literally in free fall and, at one point, the Dow was down by almost 1,600 points, the biggest ever point decline during a trading day in history. The second half of February saw good recovery with stocks regaining bounce and recovering three-quarters of those losses. But then, there was more volatility to come. The Dow lost 680 points in the final two days of the month leaving it about 1,600 points down from the record high in late January. This sharp correction was totally unexpected because it followed an extended period of extremely low volatility and against the backdrop of a strong US economy.The fall began with worries about rising inflation and the spike in US bond yields after data indicated tighter US jobs market. There was a fear that the stock markets had risen too high and too fast in recent months, and therefore a correction was both imminent and overdue. But then, the fact that it happened without any apparent trigger drew attention to a phenomenon that first appeared in the mid-seventies but which started gaining ground rapidly in the bullish period following the great financial crisis of 2008. Today, it has grown to such gigantic proportions that it threatens to become a new fault line in the financial markets. It is the rise of passive investing and the increasing importance of asset management funds that rely on a passive management or passive investing strategy.What is passive investing?Let’s begin by considering what the opposite, active investing, is about. Active funds management gives importance to the underlying fundamentals of a company in arriving at the investment potential of a particular security. Fund managers spend time and resources studying financial and valuation metrics before deciding to put money into it or recommending it to their clients and other investors. The larger purpose behind this diligence is to beat the returns generated by the broader equity markets. Unfortunately, this goal has been largely elusive during the current decade characterised as it was by a steady rise in stock prices to reach the record highs of January 2018. Indeed, the rise of passive investing can be explained in part by the demonstrated failure of active fund managers to consistently beat the markets.For instance, the S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) funds scorecard for 2016 shows that more than 60 percent of actively managed stock funds underperformed their respective market benchmarks. Mid-cap and small-cap funds were especially poor, having been beaten by the market on 89.3 percent and 85.5 percent of occasions respectively. Consequently, more and more analysts and investors saw active fund managers as being consistent underperformers and not worthy of their management fees. The role of the active manager became more difficult to justify, even more so after the financial crisis when many alternative avenues for investment emerged that brought simplicity, convenience and affordability to the investor.The passive investment strategy emerged as the alternative to active investment in that it largely ignores analyses of the fundamentals of individual securities, in favour of investing in funds consisting of a weighted basket of securities that mimic the broader underlying stock indices. Such strategies enable passive funds to replicate—and thus track—the performance of the broader index (for example, the S&P 500). It means that passive funds are not concerned with beating the market (unlike active funds) and instead aim to simply earn the market return assuming that the market is likely to rise over a sufficiently long period of time. Put simply, rather than exercise judgment about which stocks to buy, the passive fund manager will just buy the shares representing a particular index, so that the returns delivered are in sync with the chosen index. You will not get to beat the index, but you will also not underperform.The important benefit for the investor is that passive fund management fees are usually a fraction of the fee charged by active funds. According to data of 2015, some index-tracking exchange-traded funds charge as little as $3 annually for every $10,000 they manage, while the average charged by U.S. stock mutual fund managers is $131. Moreover, these funds are easier to access and more convenient to trade, particularly the exchange-traded funds (ETF) that have mushroomed with the boom in passive investing in recent years. In fact, as of the beginning of 2017, there were almost 2,000 ETFs listed on exchanges in the United States alone, which managed a total of $2.56 trillion—20 percent more than theyThe ETF market has experienced astounding growth over the last decade. There are now 5,000 ETFs traded globally with over $3.5 trillion in assets, a more than threefold increase since 2007.Where comes the risk?The problem with passive investing is that a market shock, as in the first week of February, would cause these strategies to sell into the weakness because this is the how they are programmed. With no room for the human element in this strategy, the decision to sell will be automatic when pre-set stop loss levels are triggered. In contrast, active or value investing will also have stop loss levels that get triggered when there is a fall, but at some point, the fund managers can exercise their judgement and resume buying, such as when they feel the selling has gone too far and valuations have become cheap. Likewise, when the share price of a particular company or sector increases, its value will increase relative to the market leading to greater allocation of funds from passive investing funds. This momentum based investment leads to winning stocks that keep on winning and the relative losers to keep on losing. Clearly, the passive strategy will work well for the investor when markets are on the rise but not so in a scenario of falling stock prices.Over the past decade the US equity markets have seen strong growth in passive and systematic investment strategies that rely on momentum and volatility to decide how much risk to take. The evidence for this is seen in the huge increase in the AUM of mutual funds that are into blind index investing. In 2016, passive funds in the United States attracted $506 billion, while actively managed funds lost $341 billion in withdrawals. In fact, passive funds currently account for 29 percent of the U.S. market according to Moody‘s and are set to grab more than half the assets in the investment-management business by 2024 at the latest.The shift from active to passive assets, and specifically the decline of active value investors, reduces the ability of the market to prevent and recover from sharp corrections. The approximately US$ 2 trillion that has shifted from active and value to passive and momentum strategies since the last financial crisis has effectively removed a large pool of money that would otherwise be on standby, ready to buy shares and securities on the cheap, and thus arrest a fall in prices before it gets to crisis levels.Significantly, all these risks have come to the fore at a time of all-round valuation excesses. There is good reason to believe that most assets are at their high end of historical valuations consequent to the prolonged period of easy money policies followed by the US Fed and other central banks. Signs of these excesses can be seen everywhere, including multi-billion dollar valuations for tech startups and smartphone apps, and the sharp run up in the prices of bitcoin and other crypto- currency offerings with little or no intrinsic value.Another related development of concern is that just as the stock markets appear headed for correction, the bond markets too are showing signs of weakness. Over the past two decades, most risk models have been relying on bonds to offset equity risk, and correctly too. However, now that US Federal Reserve has turned its back on easy money, this assumption is unlikely to hold true. From now on, when stock markets fall, don’t count on the bond markets to hold value. Indeed, one should not be surprised if stocks and bonds fall at the same time, a very unpleasant scenario for the market. In sum, the shift of investor funds towards passive or momentum investing, as opposed to active or value investing, has opened a new fault line that has the potential to tip over the markets into another crisis.Published in Unique Times, April 2018(V.P.

Making predictions about gold prices is never easy because unlike other commodities where prices are driven by demand and supply, gold is also ultra-sensitive to international economic and political trends of the day. And that is why predictions by experts and industry insiders about where gold is headed often turn out no better than the layman’s stray opinion.Last January, in these very pages, I had said that gold was more than likely to hold its own, and with an upward bias. This was when the overall mood was one of pessimism, with gold having surrendered much of its gains during 2016 following shock events like Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory. My view was based largely on expectations of aggravated political uncertainties, doubts about whether the US Federal Reserve would be able to go ahead with interest rates hikes, and the fear of inflation resurfacing in the US with an expansionary fiscal policy under President Trump. As it turned out, the US Fed did succeed in pushing through three interest rate hikes, political tensions were no worse than in 2016, and US inflation continued to rule below 2 percent. However, the prediction that gold price would move up turned out to be true with gold price having gained nearly 13 percent in 2017.A recap of gold price movement in recent yearsThe international price of gold experienced a steady and continuous upward trend from US $271.04 per troy ounce in 2001 to its all-time high price of around USD $1,900 per troy ounce September 2011. Thereafter, gold price remained range bound for some months and subsequently started declining steadily from 2013 to reach USD $1,060 by the end of calendar year 2015.Here is a tabular summary of gold price movements in the international markets over the last five years.Calendar YearOpeningHighLowClosing% Change20131,6581,6941,1921,205-27.3%20141,2051,3851,1421,2060.1%20151,2061,2961,0491,060-12.1%20161,0601,3661,0601,1468.1%20171,1461,3461,1461,29112.7%The year 2016 was marked by unusual volatility (at one point gold was up 26 percent only to close the year with a more modest 8 percent gain) due to one-off events like Brexit and the shock of the Trump victory in the US. In contrast, 2017 was much more subdued with gold up by 17.5 percent at the peak and closing the year with a net gain of 12.7 percent.What, then, were the key factors that mattered for gold in 2017? Here is a summary in two parts, with factors that supported gold and factors with negative impact listed separately.Factors that supported gold price in 2017US Fed rate hike: The US Federal Reserve raised its key policy rate three times in 2017, in March, June and December. Strictly speaking, when US interest rates go up, gold should fall as an alternative safe investment becomes more attractive. In this case, although the Fed raised interest rate three times, it fell short of the hawkish expectation of four such rate hikes. Moreover, following the latest hike in December, gold price increased because of uncertainty over the pace of rate hikes in 2018.Political uncertainty: The German elections in September 2017 led to re-election of Chancellor Angela Merkel with sharply reduced vote share making government formation difficult. (In fact, even as we have come to the end of January 2018, talks are still going on regarding the next government formation.) The political crisis in Spain over the demands for secession of Catalonia may result in early election in 2018, while the political uncertainties in Saudi Arabia following the anti-graft drive, and the US standoff with North Korea, all worked in favour of gold.Depreciating dollar index: The US dollar depreciated against major currencies in 2017. The dollar index, which measure the strength of US currency against a basket of other major currencies, depreciated by 9 percent in 2017, recording its biggest annual loss since 2003. The dollar index and the price of gold share an inverse relationship and it is no surprise that gold price ended the year with gains of 12.7 percent.Factors that held down gold in 2017Deprecating Yen: The re-election of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe in October 2017 — widely expected to continue ultra-loose monetary policy with further depreciation of the Yen against the US Dollar on the cards — affected gold price. Since gold has a well known inverse relationship with the Dollar, the impact was negative for gold.The US Tax reform: The introduction of the US tax reform bill which proposed cutting corporate income tax from 35 percent to 20 percent starting in 2019 further strengthened interest in US equities. The bill was subsequently passed by the US Congress and signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017. When alternative investment classes become more attractive, the impact is negative for gold price.Recovery in Global economy: The gradual recovery in the global economy especially across the major advanced economies improved trade and capital flow. This resulted in increased risk appetite with money flowing away from safe haven assets like gold and into high risk, high return assets like equity, bonds etc.What analysts expect for 2018Uncertainty in any form benefits gold in its role as a hedging instrument. In predicting the future price of gold, analysts are as usual a divided lot. Some have cautioned investors about a potential decline while others are bullish for 2018. Various commodities analysts predict gold price to remain range bound between levels of US $1200 to US $1350 an ounce in 2018. Some of the prominent forecasts for 2018 made towards end of 2017 or beginning of 2018 are given below:Goldman Sachs sees a negative six percent return from precious metals in 2018, and expects gold price to reach $1,200 per ounce by mid-2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees only limited room for rise in gold prices in 2018, due to challenging macro-economic outlook for bullion. However, the company notes that a surprise in the inflation data could bring buyers back into the gold market. It estimates gold price of $1,326 per ounce in 2018. JP Morgan’s 2018 Global Commodities Outlook sees gold prices averaging $1,295 an ounce in 2018, with levels going up only in the second half of the year to $1,340. Citigroup estimates the gold price will climb to $1,350 per ounce in 2018. Royal Bank of Canada says 2018 should bring some "measured improvements" for gold prices starting with the seasonal trend of rally in precious metals early in the first quarter. The bank forecasts the average gold price in 2018 to be $1,303 per ounces.Interestingly, at the time of this writing (end of January 2018), international gold prices have already rallied to levels of US$1,340 per ounce. The question remains, however, whether the gains will hold for the rest of the year.Our view - Positive on gold, not so for the US economyDuring calendar year 2017, gold gained nearly 13 percent in dollar terms, its best year since 2010. This came about even as equity markets regularly closed at all-time highs, and despite three Fed Funds interest rate hikes (taking the rate from 0.75 to 1.5 percent). Gold’s good performance during the last calendar year is best explained by the term “the Fear Trade”. The Fear Trade is driven by low to negative real interest rates (after accounting for inflation), high levels of deficit spending, weakening US Dollar and geopolitical uncertainty.When predicting gold prices for 2018, I would say these forces will intensify during the year. With US inflation finally showing signs of an uptick and President Donald Trump's $1.5 trillion tax reform law expected to further increase US deficit spending, calendar year 2018 could provide the right conditions to nudge gold prices higher. Further, there are risks inherent in the US Fed’s stated goal of monetary policy tightening. (The historical record of past rate hike cycles in the last 100 years shows that only 3 such cycles out of at least 18 did not end in a recession.)Let me conclude with a look at some other factors likely to hold up gold prices.Flattening yield curve signals vulnerability: The recent flattening of the yield curve in the US is a noteworthy development. The yield curve is said to "flatten" when the difference between the two-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield starts to narrow. As of today, that spread is about 0.5 percentage points, its flattest level since October 2007. This measure is worth watching because it's often seen as one of the most reliable predictors of recession. The past seven US recessions were directly preceded by an inverted yield curve (when short-term yields rose above long-term yields). While we still have some distance to go before the yield spread actually “inverts,” the current flattening may be an early warning signal.Inflation: Another factor that drives gold prices is inflation. When inflation erodes government bond yields, investors tend to seek more attractive stores of value, including gold. This is at the heart of gold's Fear Trade. In this context, official measures of US inflation have been low according to the official consumer price index (CPI). In 2017, the CPI just barely met the Fed's 2 percent target rate. However, economists using alternative and broader measures of inflation, such as the underlying inflation gauge (UIG) introduced last year by the New York Fed (which includes not just consumer prices but also producer prices, commodity prices and financial asset prices) report higher inflation. Whereas the November CPI came in at 2.2 percent, the UIG rose by 3 percent, its highest reading since August 2006.The implications are important. Three percent inflation is higher than the five-year Treasury yield, currently around 2.5 percent, and the 10-year yield, about 2.5 percent. It's even higher than the 30-year Treasury yield at 2.7 percent. When market players eventually take notice that their money invested in government bonds doesn’t keep pace with inflation, the investment case for gold becomes more attractive.US equities may be due for correction: For the moment, US equity markets have scaled new peaks following the passing of Trump’s tax plan. However, the expectation is that that this high will be short-lived. Most economists believe the Trump plan is unlikely to stimulate much economic growth without massive infrastructure spending. Further, official estimates say that the tax plan will add $1.47 trillion to the deficit. Not surprisingly, many analysts are predicting that that the party in equities will get over soon and investors might be in for a rude awakening. A fresh move by investors into gold as a safe haven asset may not then be too far away.Published in Unique Times, February 2018(V.P. Nandakumar is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.)

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. World Diabetes Day Brings India’s Diabetes Challenge To The Fore February 05, 2018Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share On November 14, India celebrated Children’s day and also marked the World Diabetes day. In 1922, Frederick Banting discovered insulin and today we acknowledge his work by spreading awareness about diabetes on his birthday. India now holds the unwelcome distinction of the world diabetes capital with as many as 70 million people suffering from the disease, a number projected to increase to 120 million in the next 20 years. The implications are grim. In a poor country like ours, the average diabetic patient is estimated to spend about Rs 25,000 annually to manage the disease and its associated complications. It has even been reported that diabetes is an underlying cause in 50 per cent of adult deaths in India. Globally, the prevalence of diabetes has doubled since 1980 rising from 4.7 percent to 8.5 percent in the adult population while the total health expenditure among adults due to the disease is estimated at USD 673 billion. What is the disease about?Diabetes is a chronic disease occurring when the pancreas is unable to make insulin or when the body is unable to make proper use of the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that allows glucose from the food we eat to pass from the blood stream into the cells in the body to produce energy. All the carbohydrates we consume is broken down into glucose in the blood. Insulin helps glucose get into the cells. The inability to produce insulin or make proper use of it leads to elevated glucose levels in the blood (known as hyperglycaemia). Over the long term, high glucose levels lead to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, which occurs usually in adults when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when it doesn’t make enough insulin. In the last three decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen sharply across the world and across all income groups. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. A Healthy diet, physical activity and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. In addition diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with medication, regular screening and treatment for complications. The Indian challengeA recent study that covered 57,000 people across 15 states and published by the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal has reported a worrying trend of poorer people especially in urban areas falling prey to the disease. This is of grave concern in India where access to health insurance or social medicine is limited and even poor people pay for treatment out of their own pockets. The mean prevalence of diabetes across all 15 states was 7.3 per cent, with the rates varying from 4.3 per cent in Bihar to 13.6 per cent in Chandigarh. Almost half of the people in the study did not know they had diabetes until they were tested. On an average, diabetes was twice as common in urban areas (11.2 per cent) than in rural areas (5.2 per cent). Living in a stressful urban environment, unhealthy dietary practices and relatively sedentary lifestyle leading to weight gain and body fat were the factors contributing to the increasing risk of diabetes. Further, the number of people with diabetes in rural areas was much higher than what was identified in previous studies. With nearly 70 per cent of population living in rural areas, even a small increase will mean several million more requiring chronic care in areas with poor access to health care. Medical health experts assert that regular check-ups and timely detection plays a vital role in controlling and managing the problem. Unfortunately, most patients tend to defer tests that can detect the disease and delay treatment that often leads to complications. Manappuram partners with Lions Clubs International to launch diabetic awareness campaignOn November 14, Lions Club International (LCI) marked World Diabetes Day with the global launch in New Delhi of a comprehensive campaign to increase awareness about the disease. Earlier, following the election of Dr.Naresh Aggarwal as its International President (incidentally, only the third Indian to ascend to this high office), Lions Clubs International had adopted diabetes as a long-term commitment that will involve support to diabetes education, treatment, research and early detection. And Manappuram Finance Ltd. is officially LCI’s corporate partner to drive the campaign in India. The highlight of the campaign, as originally proposed, was a one kilometre walkathon from Vijay Chowk to India Gate in New Delhi. However, this programme had to be postponed because of the smog that enveloped Delhi during that week. The walkathon will now take place on December 25 this year. A host of other programmes went ahead as scheduled. On November 13, international delegates and LCI’s Board members met at the Taj Palace Hotel, New Delhi, where Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Hon’ble Union Cabinet Minister, addressed the audience on the importance of implementing an actionable plan to fight diabetes in India. Dr. Jitendra Singh, Hon’ble Union Minister of State and a well-known Diabetologist, delivered a keynote speech focused on the repercussions of the disease. He also inaugurated a Mobile Diabetes Centre for the city. On this occasion, LCI also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Diabetes Foundation to reaffirm its crusade against diabetes. Seven world class health parks with open gymnasiums have been set up for the benefit of the common people of Delhi and I was invited to inaugurate the first of these, at Pitampura, on 13th November. Earlier, between the 9th and 13th November, 35 Yoga Camps were held across Delhi with the support of Patanjali Yogpeeth, which saw participation by more than 15,000 people. On 14 November, a global seminar on Diabetes was held at the Vigyan Bhavan auditorium that was addressed by Dr. T.C. Gehlot, Hon’ble Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment. Free Diabetic screening camps were organized across the Delhi NCR region in association with Apollo Hospitals to identify individuals with diabetes and refer them to qualified healthcare professionals for additional assessment (without cost to the patient). “Nukkad Nataks” or street plays were held at 75 locations across Delhi to increase awareness about the disease among ordinary people. These are early days but already, LCI has established a world record for ‘attempting the largest Diabetes awareness lesson’ targeting approximately one lakh people across India. The Certificate from the Guinness Book of World Records being the official confirmation was handed over by its adjudicator to LCI’s International President Lion Dr. Naresh Aggarwal at a press conference held at the Taj Palace, New Delhi, on 25th November 2017. LCI’s new signature cause – diabetes prevention and control campaign – will strengthen global awareness of diabetes and encourage people to lead active lifestyles to stay healthy and ward off the disease. The campaign’s activities are aimed at spreading the message of leading an active lifestyle for diabetes prevention, management and control. The members of Lion Clubs worldwide, a 1.4 million strong community, will promote this call to action under the inspirational leadership of its International President Dr.Naresh Aggarwal. At stake is a better life for millions around the world who suffer from this debilitating, lifestyle-crippling disease. Shri V.P. Nandakumar is MD&CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.

5 things to know before investing in Bitcoin | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. 5 things to know before investing in Bitcoin January 06, 2018NewsManappuram Finance Share Bitcoin is the new currency and Bitcoin mining and trading is the new passion for speculators. This crypto-currency has seen a large growth in demand in the past few years. Though the RBI has expressed some concern regarding the security of Bitcoin, this currency has generated curiosity resulting in more and more people jumping on to the bandwagon.What is a Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that can be used for making payments and can be traded and converted into any white paper currency. Bitcoin is a virtual currency, encrypted with unique digital codes. Each Bitcoin is assigned a specific number or code to provide a distinctive identity. Each transaction is recorded in a digital ledger via blockchain technology.Bitcoin in IndiaThough RBI has not provided licences to companies to trade in cryptocurrencies, many e-commercial companies like Amazon and Flipkart have started providing vouchers to Bitcoin holders. You can buy Bitcoin online and save it in your digital wallet. There are various Bitcoin exchanges available in India such as Zebplay, Unicorn, Bitxoxo, etc.Things to know before investing in Bitcoin:Bitcoin mining: Bitcoin mining is an activity through which you could mine a Bitcoin by solving a math problem. The complexity of the problem increases as more members join. Due to increasing popularity of Bitcoin mining, more and more members are joining. This growth has resulted into pool mining, wherein many independent miners join to form a group to solve a particular problem.Expensive investment: The cost of acquiring even a single Bitcoin is now prettyhigh; it’s an expensive and a speculative investment. Of course, you can opt to buy a tiny portion of Bitcoin called Satoshi. 10 crore Satoshi forms a single Bitcoin.Value of Bitcoin: The value of Bitcoin is notching up new heights every day. The current value of a single Bitcoin is approx. 10 Lakh Rupees.Risky, but high returns: Due to the absence of a regulatory body for Bitcoin, investing in it is not much different from gambling. The risks are high, but the expected returns are huge as well.Huge market capitalisation: Bitcoin's current market capitalisation is more than twice that of India's most valued companies. The increasing popularity of Bitcoin has expanded its global reach. Though some countries have criticised the use of this crypto-currency, investors in countries like the US and the UK have welcomed it with open arms.Like every other avenue for investment, investing in a Bitcoin has its own set of pros and cons. Rather just being the part of the herd, invest wisely. Invest only if you understand the concept and fundamentals of the Bitcoin, because wise investing begins when you spend your money wisely.

Digital Wallet in the Post Demonetisation Era | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Digital Wallet in the Post Demonetisation Era January 06, 2018NewsManappuram Finance Share Post demonetisation, the government launched the Digital India programme and various other policy and implementation measures to make India a less cash dependent country. In tandem with these government initiatives, a variety of private initiative for less-cash transaction facilities were also promoted to ease small ticket daily transactions in cashless ways. One such mode of cashless transaction is the Digital Wallet.What is Digital Wallet?A digital wallet refers to an electronic device that allows an individual to make mCommerce & mPayment transactions anywhere, anytime. Users can simply create and load a wallet/ account online or at the nearest shop/ franchisee/ office of a wallet service provider.One Size Does Not Fit AllThe western model of wallet usage and adoption is vastly different from India. Very high percentage of bank user base, card usage along with high POS and online shopping penetration has driven wallet usage on electronic platforms in western economies. On the other hand, India with its spread demographics, low banked base/ card usage/ branch - ATM spread, and offline heavy merchant payment/ shop trends is vastly different from the west in all aspects.Importance for IndiaThe Journey of wallets in India started with the aim to provide financial solutions and reach the unbanked population of India. Opening and managing branches/ ATM in tier two, three towns and villages is a tough ask and thus leaves the population who lack even with access to bank accounts facing hindrances in withdrawing/ depositing money and making payments.The convenience and benefit of creating and loading a wallet as also availing retailer assisted payments/shopping at your nearest and familiar local shop is the single biggest virtue. This enables a wallet company with its existing wide distribution/ franchisee/ retailer model to reach customers even in far flung areas where a bank branch or ATM service is not available. The same distribution network enables fast growing offline adoption at merchant without the need for POS card machines or cards for customers. Wallets could also act as a data point sources for financial institutions enabling customers with no credit history/ credit/ debit card/ bank usage get access to loans from these institutions.Win Win for IndiaCustomers enjoy following the benefits: (i) mini bank next door (ii) anywhere, anytime recharge (iii) utility fee payments and shopping (iv) offline retail payments at shops even without POS machine (v) ease of person to person money transfer, etc.Merchants / Agents / Franchisee enjoy benefits such as (i) no need to store cash (with all its risks) or access ATM`s for vendor payments (ii) digital payment acceptance without POS machine (and its associated costs) (iii) they can augment their income by offering digital wallet services to customer etc.Society/ Employment: Provides employment opportunity especially to the rural people, to enrol as agents/ franchisee offering the wallet services to the local populationGovernment: It is estimated that the cost of cash in Indian economy is around 1.5 percent - 1.7 percent of real GDP in 2014-15. This alone indicates the potential savings that the digital wallets ecosystem provides for governments which could easily run into lakhs of crores of rupees over a period, besides widening the tax net (which could lead eventually to lower tax rates for all brackets).To conclude, the digital wallet is a journey which needs strong support, nurturing and steady steps for further evolution which could lead to a destination likely to be win-win for all stakeholders.

Don’t Ignore Gold as an Investment Option | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Don’t Ignore Gold as an Investment Option December 12, 2017NewsManappuram Finance Share Summary:With investment in the equity markets being the flavour of the month, perhaps this is the right time for a gentle reminder why gold continues to be a relevant investment option and not be relegated to an afterthought. Gold in IndiaIndia is the largest consumer of gold in the world. Our love affair with the metal is age old. Roughly 800 to 900 tonnes, about a third of the total gold mined in the world, is consumed in India. Domestic production being negligible, we are the largest importers of gold. Gold is rare, beautiful and stable. It does not depreciate in value, nor deteriorates in quality with time. It acquired a social, emotional and economic significance beyond logical comprehension. Many of our traditions have changed over the years, but large scale purchases of gold during weddings and festivals continue. Moreover, gold has unfailingly stood as our saviour in times of financial turmoil when real estate, stocks and commodities have crashed. According to a recent nationwide debt and investment survey, an average Indian household holds 84 percent of its wealth in real estate, 11 percent in gold and the remaining 5 percent in financial assets (such as deposits and savings accounts, equity shares, mutual funds, life insurance and retirement accounts).Investing in goldGiven the importance of gold in India, it is not surprising that it enjoys pride of place in the common man’s investment portfolio. After all, it is one of the safest avenues for investment, equivalent to bank deposits that, additionally, has offered better protection against the ravages of inflation. Over the last decade and a half, gold has delivered fairly high returns when compared to other risk free investments. Throughout history, gold has been regarded as a store of value, known to provide risk free real returns especially when inflation is up. For example, the average consumer price inflation during the three high inflation years from FY2011-12 to FY 2013-14 was nearly 10 percent. Fixed deposits with banks during this period gave negative inflation adjusted returns whereas the price of gold in India went up by 38 percent to deliver positive real returns. Internationally, the yellow metal has outperformed the S&P 500 since the beginning of the century, returning 86 percent more than the market according to the World Gold Council.In India, the recent boom in the stock market has delivered handsome returns to seasoned traders and it has now lured less experienced retail investors to jump onto the bandwagon. While the returns have been high, it also comes with a fair amount of risk. And so, to protect one’s hard-earned savings, professional investment advisors often recommend investment through mutual funds which diversify risk on behalf of individual investor. But then, the common investor is confused by the array of mutual funds offering diverse categories and literally hundreds of schemes to choose from. Homing in on the right stock or mutual fund to buy into is not easy, and keeping track of its price movements is another hassle. Interestingly, when stock markets are trading at historical highs (both in India and abroad), and when the fears of an impending correction appear plausible, gold makes an excellent case for stepped up investment. After all, it is a general observation that when stock markets collapse during periods of economic woes, gold price often heads up in keeping with its status as a safe haven investment. The below table indicates how the international price of gold moved during eight periods of the biggest decline in US stock market over the last four decades. ConclusionThe verdict is clear. Gold is reliably known to hold its value during troubled times. With frothy stock markets all around, maybe now is the time to increase the allocations for gold in one’s portfolio. Of course, it is true that in recent years there was a substantial correction in international gold price from the peak levels of 2011 and 2012. However, beginning from January 2016, gold prices have regained ground and have generally held steady in the range of US$ 1,200 to US$ 1,300.Finally, all said and done, a prudent investor will be wise to invest her savings in a diversified basket of investment options such as bank deposits, mutual funds, real estate, equity shares, gold and gold jewellery, etc. It helps to spread the risk as against having all your eggs in one basket. Investment in gold and jewellery for the long term is a safe option because the supply of physical gold continues to be meagre in relation to the demand. Therefore, while the price may fluctuate, there is protection on the downside. Recently, Gold bonds have emerged as a useful alternative to those who buy gold purely for investment purpose who now get to earn some interest on their investments though it may not interest those who buy gold jewellery for consumption.

Valapad: A fully e-literate village in Kerala | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Valapad: A fully e-literate village in Kerala October 05, 2017Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share alapad: A fully e-literate village in KeralaValapad is a rather unremarkable coastal village in the Thrissur district. The Valapad Panchayat comprises 20 wards, with 35,237 households, out of which 40 percent fall below poverty line. These days, Valapad has come to be known to the outside world as the head office of Manappuram Finance Limited, one of India’s leading NBFCs with branches across the country. Recently, however, the village of Valapad came to prominence for a different reason. On March 9, 2017, the Governor of Kerala, Hon’ble Justice P. Sathasivam (Retd.) declared Valapad to be a fully e-literate village. As a matter of fact, when the movement for digitalization gathered pace across India, Kerala was in the forefront. On February 27, 2016, then President Shri Pranab Mukherjee declared Kerala as the first digital state in India. A year later, a small coastal village of the state has come under the spotlight, bringing to mind the words of Mahatma Gandhi, “the future of India lies in its villages.” This accomplishment is the outcome of new paradigm of co-operation between the local government, a leading educational institution of the area, and a company based in Valapad—the Valapad Grama Panchayat, S.N College, Nattika, and Manappuram Finance Limited. The concept of E-Valapad was first suggested by Mr. V.P. Nandakumar, the MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Limited, as a CSR project that would also fulfil a pressing need of the community then trying to cope with the impact of demonetisation. The goal of the project was to make at least one member of each family capable of performing digital transactions using a web enabled device such as a smart phone or computer. The project also targeted the local shopkeepers and small business owners with this purpose in mind. Students of S.N. College, Nattika, drawn from its Commerce and Economics faculty, went out into all the wards of Valapad Panchayat to provide training to people over a period of one week. They took the help of ward members of the Panchayat, Asha workers and Anganwadi teachers, backed up by technology and logistics support given by officials of the marketing department of Manappuram Finance and the Counsellors of the Manappuram Foundation. Training was given to enable people to perform useful financial transactions by using debit cards, smart phone (especially the BHIM app for financial transactions), POS machine and internet banking. The training department of Manappuram Finance provided professional quality training material to the students. After the successful completion of Project E-Valapad, Mr. V.P Nandakumar (MD and CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd.) said that the company was open to the idea of implementing a similar project in other Panchayats as well. In this modern day world where rapid technological change leads to the birth of new ideas and new ways of doing things almost every day, there is constant change in the requirements of people. No one is exempt from the change happening all around us. As we head deeper into the digital age, the knowledge of information technology assumes great significance. If India’s villages don’t embrace these changes, it will only widen the existing inequality between people villages and cities, with unhappy consequences to the economy of the country. A truly developed country is one where the fruits of development are distributed equitably between its urban and rural areas. Therefore, the Indian government has a responsibility to ensure that the fruits of development reach the remotest villages in the country. Against this backdrop, the success achieved by Valapad Panchayat shows that in the matter of acquiring digital literacy, even an ordinary village and its inhabitants need not fall behind their sophisticated urban counterparts. And, all this was the outcome of an unlikely coming together of the Valapad Panchayat, the students of a local college, and Manappuram Finance Limited, a corporate entity with deep roots in Valapad that also prides itself on its social conscience.

What Have You Learnt Today? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. What Have You Learnt Today? January 10, 2017HRManappuram Finance Share Let me begin with a story.There was once a Monk who had through his Master, learnt everything that could be learned. He memorized all the Scriptures and all the science available in his time. He became proficient in them, he became a great scholar; his fame started spreading all over the country.When there was nothing else to be taught, the master said, ”You have known all that can be taught by me. Now you can go out in the world and come back after learning something new.” The monk was confused. What could he possibly learn from the outside world that could not be taught by his Master. However, he did not wish to question the wisdom of his Master and decided to learn something new for himself. His journey carried him through a forest and he was not ready for the sight that he was to face.What an astonishing sight!’ cried the Monk. In the forest place he had come across a fox that had no legs. ‘How can it possibly live?’ he wondered, ‘for it looks healthy enough.’Suddenly his senses made him aware of a Lion who was coming upon the scene. He quickly climbed a tree and watched in awe what happened next. The lion had killed a deer. It dropped the carcass near the fox, ate its fill, and then went off, leaving bits of the meat behind. Quickly the fox ate the lot.‘Even more astonishing!’ gasped the Monk. He couldn’t believe what he had seen. So, next day he again came out into the forest and again hid on the tree. The same thing happened. The lion appeared with a freshly killed deer, ate what it wanted, leaving portions of the meat for the fox to finish.‘It’s a sign from God!’ the Monk said, for I have learnt something new. ‘From now on I, too, will rely, like the fox, upon the generosity of the Creator. This was one thing that my master had not taught me and I need to put it to practice and share the results with my master’. He soon found himself a dark corner against a wall and settled to wait.‘God will provide,’ he said to himself.He sat there for several days and neither friend nor stranger went near him. More days passed. He grew thinner and thinner until his veins and skin were stretched like harp strings on his bony frame.At length, when he was almost too weak to move, he pleaded a group of people to lead him back to his school before he would die, for he wanted to tell his master that though he had learnt something new, it could not be applied in practice.As soon as he was brought to the school, the master and the other disciples took him and cared him back to health. After he was well and was able to speak, his teacher enquired what the matter was.The Monk poured out his story. ‘Now tell me,’ he said when he had finished, ‘surely that was a sign from God? For I had only imitated what I had learnt’‘Of course it was,’ replied the holy man, ‘but how could you be such an idiot? Why didn’t you see that you were supposed to imitate not the fox but the lion?’There is so much to learn from this simple story. The two most important learnings that I would like to point out are:i) There is never a time in life where one can assume that he has learnt everything. Learning never stops.ii) How to make the right choice when putting the learning to practice is also a learning in itself.This story also reminds me of the couplet by Kabir in which the poet says: ‘If here before me stand both my Guru (teacher) and Govind (the almighty), I’d first prostrate before my Guru, because it is He who revealed to me the Govind!’ Manohar K NairVice President – HRM Training Previous BlogA Brief Introduction on Fraud & Fraud Control in Our OrganisationNext BlogEmployment Brand of NbfcsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

Employment Brand of Nbfcs | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Employment Brand of Nbfcs November 10, 2016HRManappuram Finance Share Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) form a vital part of the Indian financial system. They play a significant role in nation building and financial inclusion by complementing the role of the banking sector in reaching out and extending credit facilities to the unbanked sections of society. NBFCs have scripted a spectacular success story in the history of the Indian economy. Their contribution to the economy has grown from 8.4% in 2006 to over 14% in March 2015. In terms of financial assets, NBFCs have recorded a substantial growth—a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the past few years—and today comprise 13% of the total credit exposure, and which is expected to reach nearly 18% by 2018–19.In the last one decade, non-banking financial companies, especially Gold Loan NBFCs, have seen remarkable growth in the country. From a couple of south based players in a few years ago, the sector has seen the entry of many new players. Moreover, with the banking system clearly constrained in terms of expanding their lending activities, the role of NBFCs becomes even more significant given the strong focus of the government on promoting entrepreneurship with the objective to remake India into a country of job creators instead of job seekers.NBFCs are using both traditional and modern tools for talent acquisition and retention. As NBFCs expand further, a lot more employment opportunities will arise across the industry. New entities, new topography, new business model and huge cross-selling opportunities will necessitate both mass and non-mass hiring in the sector. Going forward, it will be common to see a breed of niche NBFC specialists with very polished skill sets. According to industry sources, the three leading Gold Loan NBFCs have given direct employment to more than 60,000 people. As companies in the NBFC sector grow, it’s essential for hiring managers to use technology to bridge the geographical divide in a cost-effective manner. It’s not always efficient to have a hiring manager stationed in each and every town and so using video conferencing, online assessment and other technologies for virtual hiring processes are necessary and imminent. We’ve seen that this ensures quality of the hire and, at the same time, increases efficiency of the process.Women form an integral part of today’s workforce, especially important in the financial services sector. A large chunk of this pool is, however, seen to “drop out” of the work force at a mid-management level, mainly to focus on raising the family. At Manappuram, we realize there is a huge talent pool of women who want to return to work after having their children grow up. Therefore, there is a conscious effort on the part of our recruitment processes to be inclusive and empathetic towards women in our workforce.Returning employees form yet another pool of talent that is being recognized by organizations. Rehiring is beneficial to the both the employee, who is choosing to return to a familiar environment, as well as for the employer who is recruiting someone who’s already familiar with the company culture and infrastructure. This also helps increase hiring process efficiency and also lower the training period and the related costs.Hiring is no longer the sole agenda of the HR fraternity and is today being increasingly driven by business leaders including CEOs. Companies are realising that it’s equally important to attract talent as it is to attract customers. Marketing-style campaigns that traverse through traditional and social media mean substantial spends on building a credible “employer brand”. Top talent today is aware of their market-worthiness and “select” employers as much as they are selected by employers. Providing a breakthrough experience to a potential job seeker helps spread the word of mouth and serves as a brilliant marketing tool for an organization. In contrast, a bad hiring experience may cause the right applicant to turn down the job.One of the most effective tools for employer branding is the retention of existing employees. Retention in today’s world begins from the very first day of recruitment. To motivate high potential talent within the workforce, one can offer structured leadership development programmes that focus on functional and managerial skills. A highly motivated and enthusiastic staff will positively influence the employer brand in today’s inter-connected world of social networks. Talent retention, thus, plays a crucial role in new talent acquisition. Renjith P.R.DGM – HRM Training Previous BlogWhat Have You Learnt Today?Next BlogA Report on the Activities of Smt.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. A Report on the Activities of Smt. Sarojini Padmanabhan Memorial Women’s Club October 27, 2016Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share The Club was inaugurated on March 8th 2016 by our Hon’ble MD & CEO in the presence of Smt. Subhashini Teacher, Block Panchyath President, and Smt. Sushama Nandakumar, Managing Director of Manappuram Jewellers Ltd. and Patron of the Club.On June 5th, we celebrated “World Environmental Day” by planting trees at Vidhya Vilasam UP School, Palliprom. An awareness class on the subject of “Importance of Environmental Protection” was given to the students of the School. On 24th Sept., the Club partnered IMA Thrissur for a blood donation camp. While we could mobilize 115 members for blood donation, only 50 donors were accepted due to technical constraints. The next programme of the Club was a training session on Team Building. A total of 85 members participated in the training. The entire team learned and enjoyed the training successfully.World Environment Day observedA training programme on team buildingOctober 1st was a special day for the Smt. Sarojini Padmanabhan Women’s Club. The team was very enthusiastic about going to the “Pakal Veedu” at Thalikulam. Despite it being a working day, they could find time to go to the Pakal Veedu. The club members utilised the opportunity to meet the elderly people at Pakal Veedu and get to know them. They spent some time with them at Lunch Break. There was a musical performance by Ms. Sunitha, Aiswarya and Remya. Their performance seemed to have some therapeutic effects on their minds and bodies as some of them sang along and some even danced with the team. Afterwards, the senior most among them cut a cake and it was shared among. We realized how the magic of kind words works on elderly people. Some of our members sat with them, held their hands, or put an affectionate arm over their shoulders... We recognized the warmth behind the wrinkled faces and hands.... Yes... they seemed happy with the love and affection conveyed by the team which they had perhaps been missing for years now. We saw sparkles of cheer and vivid feelings on their worn out faces....we saw the tears of happiness that rolled down their faces. There are no words to explain their feelings of warmth... we were lucky to see it for ourselves and wish more people would experience this. International Elderly Peoples’ Day celebrated at the Pakal Veedu in ThalikulamOur second engagement on this day was to honour the elderly parents of our women employees. Usually we go to our friends’ homes for a marriage or their kids’ birthdays or to express condolences etc. But when we go specifically to see their aged parents, the experience is different as we found out on the International Elderly Peoples’ day, 1st October 2016. A special thanks to Shini T.S. (Civil Dept) and family for the opportunity given to the Women’s Club to come over and meet her elderly in-laws (aged 85 and 76). They were pleasantly surprised to meet their daughter-in-law’s friends from work. They acknowledged the gesture as a very special moment in their life and we felt gratified.Finally, we all went for a picnic on 9th October. The unique feature of the picnic was that we were all female employees accompanied by our kids and we went to Kalady Sree Sankara Acharya Sthoopam, Kodanad Elephant Camp, Poru Water Falls and the Cherai Beach. We were a group of 70 persons including kids. It was a wonderful trip and all the kids had a blast.

Brexit and the Boost for Gold | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Brexit and the Boost for Gold August 15, 2016NewsManappuram Finance Share The uncertainty over the referendum ended with the UK voting on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU. After the referendum, opinion is divided among financial analysts and economists about the long term consequences of the event. Those who campaigned for the exit option believe it will be negative only over the short term. In the long run the outcome will be positive for UK, with savings of GBP 8.50 billion per annum (said to be the country’s net contribution to EU) and freedom to pursue its own trade deals. They are hopeful that Britain will manage to negotiate a free trade deal with Europe on special terms, similar, for example, to EU’s Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA) recently negotiated with Canada.Opponents of exit are sceptical anticipating a negative impact on the UK and the EU economy as a whole which will lead to a global economic slowdown. Whether other EU countries would offer a generous trade deal to the UK is one of the unknowns of the debate. While the pro-exit camp believes it would be in the interests of other European countries to re-establish free trade, their opponents suggest that the EU would want to make life hard for Britain in order to discourage further breakaways.A study by the think-tank Open Europe, which campaigns for radical reforms in the EU, found that the worst-case "Brexit" scenario is that the UK economy loses 2.2 per cent of its total GDP by 2030 which may not be cause for alarm given that the recession of 2008-09 wiped out about 6 percent off its GDP. However, it says that GDP could rise by 1.6 per cent if the UK was able to negotiate a free trade deal with Europe – i.e. to maintain the current trade set-up – and pursued "very ambitious deregulation."Notwithstanding the pros and cons of the issue, the immediate reaction by the global financial markets was one of surprise and panic. The British Pound lost significant value, sliding 8 percent against the USD on the day of the results, its biggest one-day fall since the age of free-floating exchange rates began. Stocks markets in the U.S. and Europe also fell sharply, and an unprecedented $3 trillion was erased from stock exchanges around the world in the two trading days following the results.Since then, stock markets have rebounded after governments and central banks indicated they were ready to do “whatever it takes” to prevent slippages in their economies. The Bank of England has now cut interest rates to a historic low of 0.25 percent accompanied by a £170bn package of stimulus measures. Earlier, the Japanese government had announced a fiscal stimulus said to be worth USD 276 billion. All this in a world already awash in fiscal and monetary stimulus money, with the US alone estimated to have pumped in $7.66 trillion between 2008 and 2012. Injection of newly minted money is likely only to extend the lull before the next big storm. Good times, we know, don’t last forever. But, whether artificially propping up the economy with liquidity will hold back bad times forever, remains uncertain. There is, however, one asset class about which there is no uncertainty and that is gold. Investment in gold has long been held as the best option for risk-averse investors in uncertain times. It was proved again as gold jumped nearly 5 percent (to US$ 1,315) on the day of the Brexit verdict. In fact, even before the vote, gold had already posted gains of 20 percent during the year given the continuing growth woes in the developed world and with China faltering too. Since 1974, gold has not had a better first half of the year. Importantly, despite all the gains so far, the key takeaway today is that more appreciation is likely. Outlook for gold priceGold price is, by and large, inversely related to interest rate being non-interest bearing. Any rise in uncertainty in the global market, and risk-averse investors pull out money from risky assets to park in safe haven investments like dollar denominated bonds and gold. Similarly, falling interest rates nudge gold price higher as the opportunity cost of holding the asset falls.The slow pace of recovery after the 2008 meltdown has compelled central banks across the globe to maintain low, even negative, interest rates to stimulate growth or to shore up whatever little of momentum there is. This easy money stance with interest rates held artificially low increases risk appetite. A significant chunk of this money then gets diverted to emerging markets in quest of higher returns pushing up stock indices in these parts while the lack of positive returns from bonds makes gold more attractive to hold.The latest data from the World Gold Council shows record investment in gold in the first half of 2016 with investors buying 1,064 tons during the first six months of 2016, 16 percent more than in the first half of 2009 when the financial crisis was most acute. Investment, rather than jewellery, was the largest component of gold demand for two consecutive quarters, which has not happened before. Individual investors, recoiling from historically low interest rates on bank deposits, have also been buying up gold bars and coins. Demand for the U.S. gold Eagle coins has jumped 84 percent this year.Not surprisingly then, Bank of America analysts in July upped their target on gold to $1,475 noting, “the world has been walking from crisis to crisis and we see risks that this may not change." Analysts with Credit Suisse have suggested that $1,500 an ounce mark could be tested by the end of the year in view of the prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty while UBS says gold “is more compelling than ever” today because of low and negative interest rates and global geopolitical risks.After experimenting with artificially low interest rates, the trend towards negative interest rates on sovereign bonds is proving to be another support for gold. The conventional argument against investing in gold is that the metal generates no income while investment in bonds and shares fetches interest and dividends which offset the risk of fall in capital values. In contrast, when you invest in gold, you are effectively betting only on favourable price movements.However, with the trend towards negative interest rates in the advanced economies, holding on to cash and gold is now a sensible option. According to a recent reports in the international press, about US$13.4 trillion of sovereign bonds, primarily European and Japanese, are trading with negative yields. For many central banks these days, it’s become a race to the bottom and beyond. Moreover, a number of highly rated corporate bonds are also beginning to get into the negative yield business. The case for gold has become stronger.Of course, if there is a dark cloud somewhere, it is that the most recent upsurge in gold price has been driven strongly by exchange traded funds (ETFs) getting back in to the market. The risk is that demand will fade once there is an economic recovery prompting investment to head elsewhere. And that is the potential threat to gold price going forward. Other likely consequencesPost Brexit, there can be significant, but difficult to predict, negative spill-over to the euro area in the days to come via a number of channels, including trade and the financial markets. However, losses may not be as large as earlier feared even if Article 50 (which governs exit from EU) is triggered immediately because the UK’s trading arrangements with the rest of the EU is likely to remain unchanged for at least two years (possibly longer).Brexit has given hope to Euro-sceptic political parties across Euro-zone to pursue their own exit options. While markets have so far managed so far to ride out the impact, the real danger is that it may strengthen anti-EU voices in European countries, some of which may follow suit. With elections coming up next year in the Netherlands, France and then Germany (these economies together represent more than half the euro-zone output), the worries are real. An upsurge in anti EU sentiments leading to further pullouts from the EU would pull the EU economy into recession which will spill over to the global economy via trade and finance. A slowdown in global economy would impact US growth rate. Any uncertainty and weakness in the global economy would likely further delay the process of normalisation of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve. And that will, once again, strengthen the appetite for gold among investors. V.P. Nandakumar is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd. and Chairman of CII, Kerala State Council.

The functions undertaken by HRD are to recruit, select, train and develop employees for an organization. Today with companies having a global mix of employees, developing an understanding of the employees is a tough task for the HR Department. Human Resource Management is a process of bringing people and organizations together, so that their respective goals are met. Indian organizations are also witnessing a change in systems, management cultures and philosophy due to the increasing global alignment of Indian companies. As globalization has been a challenging issue for the organization—because international human resource management has placed great emphasis on number of responsibilities and functions such as relocation, orientation, translation services to help employees adapt to new and different environment outside their own country— necessary attention must be paid by HR Managers in formulating policies, motivation, maintaining the relationship and stressing on quality in administration. HR does this in a measurable way. HR functionaries need to do a lot of things. In the end, HR plays the role of initiator, planner and executor in organizations. Taking a look at the world of human beings is a rewarding experience. Contracts abound in this world. These contracts remain so despite the passage of time, sweeping political & economic changes, cultural differences. HR could be the ultimate differentiator in the competitive marketplaces of the future. But first ”Old HR” must be deconstructed. Great companies have for years been eliminating wasteful process that don’t move the talent needle in the organization. It is critical to challenge historical norms, eliminate bureaucracy, deploy the latest data technology, and optimize organizational structure, no matter what your job title is, we are all in the HR, because employees are at the heart of every organizational success. In early 1900s, HR function known as industrial and labour relation after steel and oil had transformed business in the 19th century, it become clear that workforce management needs its own discipline. Later in 1920s in a thriving economy, good workers were hard to come by and even harder to retain. HR introduced supervisors to treat people well.During the 1930s, the era of the great depression, supervisors favoured the drive system of Management (threatening and sometimes even hitting workers) and saw HR as a hindrance. Workers put up with almost anything to stay employed. Talent development was practically nonexistent. In the1950s, after the Second World War, Western countries lost 1/3rd of their executives in the war with no one to replace them. To fill that void, HR created a host of revolutionary hiring and development programmes. In the 1970s, as the economy slowed, labour was once again plentiful. Business Leaders started undoing all those post-war programmes designed to attract and develop talent. Early 1980s, the US went in to deep recession and workers clung to their jobs. Rather than invest in HR, companies pushed hiring and developments tasks onto line managers, who had neither the time nor the training to do it properly. Late 1990s, during the dot-com boom, companies competed fiercely for employer of choice status to meet their soaring talent needs. So, HR enjoyed a brief heyday, focusing primarily on hiring and retention. From 2001, when the dot-com bubble burst and the economy tanked, business leaders felt little urgency to attract talent. Productivity rose, wages stayed flat, and HR lost the influence it had enjoyed during the boom. Nowadays, with the effects of the great recession of 2008 still lingering, most people with jobs aren’t jumping ship yet, so executives feel no urgent need for HR programmes. HR has to first make a case for it and these days HR focuses attention on the following:1. Policies- HR policies based on trust, openness, equity and consensus.2. Motivation- Create conditions in which people are willing to work with zeal, initiative and enthusiasm; make people feel like winners.3. Relations- Fair treatment of people and prompt redress of grievances would pave the way for healthy work-place relations.4. Change agent- Prepare workers to accept technological changes by clarifying doubts.5. Quality Consciousness- Commitment to quality in all aspects of personnel administration will ensure success. It is true that any individual who works in the HR Department must be “a people person”. Employees are human, not commodities, and HR departments have to start seeing them differently. With the current push towards strategies that engage employees, attract top talent, and contribute to the bottom line, this change is imperative. The HR department creates competitive advantage by building strong organizations, strong leaders, managers, strong teams and employees. HR Department does this in a measurable way. Some of the modern trends in HR are ,Employee Committee with Genuine Authority, Database for Employee Suggestions In Implementation ,Ownership of Business- Job Rotation, Training to learn multiple skills, Open Culture/Caring Environment ,Hiring The Smartest People, Create Cool, Simple & Yet Highly Efficient Workforce ,Cross Functional Job Rotation ,Self Defence Techniques For Women Employees ,Work From Home ,Mentorship and Buddy Programme ,Encouraging Social Services ,Paid Leave For Social Services ,Stock Options ,Confirmed Employees From The First Day Of Joining , Mandatory Training Hours- Any Field of Interest ,Internal Promotions – Non Mgmt To Top Management Position ,Knowledge Sharing Sessions, Recognize Employee Achievements,100 % Reimbursement Of Tuition Fees/Examination Fees For Employee Professional Development ,Sense Of Security/Family Taken Care, Working Beyond Revenues ,Fast Track Programme For Promoting Middle Managers ,Leadership Programme For Young Managers.Health Café, Yoga Classes, Stress Management etc. If HR is to be perceived as an enabler of business strategies they need to be seen by measurable contributions to the bottom line through expense reduction or revenue generation, talent management and risk mitigation. HR departments of today need to be talent of tomorrow. At the end of the day, individual employees do most of the tangible work for organization. HR, however, has always been overly supportive of and biased towards the managers and the business ideas, leaving the larger populace with no real recourse.Renjith P.R(DGM–HRM-T) Previous BlogBrexit and the Boost for GoldNext BlogA New Festival in Town – the Manappuram Loan MelaPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

V.C. Padmanabhan Memorial Awards for Excellence, 2016 | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. V.C. Padmanabhan Memorial Awards for Excellence, 2016 June 25, 2016AwardsManappuram Finance Share By V. P. NandakumarFrom 2002 onwards, every year in the month of June, Manappuram has been commemorating its founder, my father late V.C. Padmanabhan. In the initial years, the programme involved a lecture delivered by an eminent personality drawn from business, government or the academic world. Over the years, we have had stalwarts like Prof. Debashis Chatterjee (Director, IIM-K), Dr. V.A. Joseph (MD and CEO, South Indian Bank Ltd., Thrissur), Shri. P.C. Cyriac, IAS - Rtd. (Chairman, Federal Bank Ltd., Aluva) and Shri V.K. Mathews (MD, IBS Software Services Pvt. Ltd.) to deliver the lecture before a select, invited audience. This year’s lecture was delivered by Shri P.N. Vasudevan, MD of Equitas Holdings Ltd., the man behind Equitas Microfinance who spoke on the topic of “Microfinance and Poverty Alleviation”. Later, in 2010, we instituted the annual V.C. Padmanabhan Memorial Awards for Excellence to honour distinguished personalities for their outstanding contributions to society. Over the last six years, these awards have acquired prestige and become an important event in the calendar. Prominent personalities who have accepted the awards in previous years include Dr. E. Sreedharan (MD, Delhi Metro), Shri Vinod Rai (Former CAG), Shri M. Damodaran (Former Chairman, SEBI), Ustad Amjad Ali Khan (renowned musician) and Shri Adoor Gopalakrishnan (internationally acclaimed film director). This year’s awards carried a cash prize of Rs.2 lakhs and a bronze plaque. Prominent winners for 2016 included the eminent Malayalam novelist and screenplay writer Padma Bhushan M.T. Vasudevan Nair, the noted environmentalist Padma Shri Dr. Sunita Narain, and former Union Minister and Member of Parliament Prof. K.V. Thomas. Why Manappuram cherishes the memory of its founder so much is worth an explanation. A casual reading of the Manappuram story will tell you that my father started the business in 1949 and managed it till 1986, when he passed away. At the time, Manappuram was a single branch business located in Valapad. Today, we have a presence across India with 3,747 branches spanning 28 states and UTs. What these numbers don’t tell you is that even as Manappuram remained a single branch outfit, my father had built up enormous goodwill for the business among the local people who trusted him fully with their hard earned money. And, it is a testament to his integrity, that he was one of the select few from the business community of this area who paid his income tax religiously in the seventies and eighties. Integrity, to him, was a way of life. After I took over, I was lucky that India began its liberalisation in 1991. It presented opportunities to me that were just not available to an earlier generation of ethical, law abiding entrepreneurs. After taking over, I decided to expand the business. I was able to tap into this reservoir of goodwill and take advantage of the much improved business climate. And so, when I promoted Manappuram Finance Ltd. in 1992, much of the initial capital came from the local people who instinctively trusted the name “Manappuram” and did not hesitate to invest their hard earned savings. That’s why, even as Manappuram has grown into a national presence with an international footprint (in terms of our investors), we never forget that we owe it all to the vision and values of our Founder, and that legacy of goodwill left behind by him that was the real fortune I inherited. And these awards are a reminder of our Founder’s commitment to excellence of which we are the beneficiaries. We have chosen to express our gratitude to our founder by recognising excellence in public personalities from which society as a whole has gained. Incidentally, my father passed away in 1986 and this year marks his 30th death anniversary.

Financial Inclusion and prospects in the Northeast Region | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Financial Inclusion and prospects in the Northeast Region December 20, 2018NewsManappuram Finance Share The Indian banking system is recognized as being robust and well regulated. Since nationalization, the Indian banking system has undergone dramatic changes. For example, recently India became one of the few countries to begin implementing Basel III norms. On the other hand, banking system is yet to penetrate into the hinterlands. Around 41% of the Indian population is still unbanked, of which, 40% belong to urban regions, while 60% belong to rural areas. Only 14% of the adult population has access to credit accounts with formal financial institutions. What is financial inclusion and why is it so important? According to the Planning Commission (2009), financial inclusion refers to universal access to a wide range of financial services at a reasonable cost. These include not only banking products but also other financial services such as insurance and equity products. The household access to financial services includes access to contingency planning, credit and wealth creation. Access to contingency planning would help for future savings such as retirement savings, buffer savings and insurable contingencies and access to credit includes emergency loans, housing loans and consumption loans. On the other hand, access to wealth creation includes savings and investment based on household’s level of financial literacy and risk perception.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) continues efforts to ensure extension of banking facilities to all unbanked villages. As a result, around 490,000 unbanked villages with population less than 2000 were identified. Banks are required to extend coverage under the on-going Phase II of the financial inclusion roadmap. As reported by the State Level Bankers Committees (SLBCs), around 390,387 villages were covered by 14,207 branches, 357,856 Business Correspondents (BCs) and 18,324 other modes, such as automated teller machines (ATMs) and mobile vans were setup as of March 2015. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is perhaps the most significant initiative towards financial inclusion in India till date. PMJDY is on its way to achieving its goal and has been instrumental in bringing almost all families of the country into the formal financial system. It has enabled citizen at grassroots level to perform financial transaction and keep their hard earned money safe. The scheme was started with the objective to provide universal access to banking facilities’ through:(a) “Basic Saving Bank Account” with an overdraft up-to Rs.5,000 subject to satisfactory operation in the account for six months(b) RuPay Debit card with inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh and (c) Provision of social security schemes, i.e. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Atal Pension Yojana. As of August 2015, around 180 million bank accounts have been opened covering nearly all households and the expectation is that eventually wage payments and subsidies will be directly routed to the bank accounts of beneficiaries.Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP)Under the Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been encouraging banks to adopt a structured and planned approach towards financial inclusion. Out of 3,445 rural bank branches opened during 2014-15, 2,230 branches were opened in unbanked rural centres. Around 155 million basic savings bank deposit accounts (BSBDAs) were added taking the total BSBDAs to 398 million. This includes 147 million accounts opened under PMJDY. With the addition of 2.6 million small farm sector credit accounts (Kisan Credit Cards-KCCs) and 1.8 million small, non-farm sector credit accounts (General Credit Cards - GCCs), the total number of such accounts went up to nearly 42.5 million and 9.2 million respectively.Much has been done to increase the outreach of the financial system and tap into the unbanked population of the country. While the ongoing efforts of the government and the RBI are showing signs of success, it is however too early to declare victory. There is still a long way to go as financial inclusion has helped in opening basic bank accounts for the excluded but ensuring it remains operational requires sustained efforts. This will be possible only if all government subsidies and payments are routed through the banking channel. Besides, improved infrastructure facilities and a technology based BC model with proper network connectivity is key to the long term success of the programme. Some earlier studies have shown that there are still many untouched pockets in the country that remain isolated from formal financial services. As per the available information compiled by NSSO (2012), there are about 203 million households in India. Around 89.3 million households are farmers, of which 51.4 percent (i.e. 45.9 million out of 89.3 million) are financially excluded from both formal and informal financial sources. In addition, 256 districts out of 640 districts in India (representing 40 percent of total districts), have critical credit exclusion thresholds in respect of access to formal credit. Northeast, Eastern and Central India account for 64 percent of all financially excluded farmer households in India. Overall indebtedness to formal finance sources is low at 19.66 percent in these three regions.Scope for gold loans in Northeast The Gold Loan business can be a boon to the regional economy by making small ticket loans easily available to the financially excluded. Our preliminary studies indicate good potential for gold loans in the isolated north east region (NER) of India. If we can expand our branch network to this region manned by trained staff with local knowledge, it would service the financial need of the region and deepen the financial inclusion process. Some basic fact about the NER of India (which consists of eight states, namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim) are as follows: • The region covers an area of around 2.62 lakhs Sq. Km. constituting 7.9 percent of the country’s total geographical area. According to the 2011 census, total population of NER is around 45 million (about 3.8 percent ) of the country’s population. • More than 80 percent of the population resides in rural areas.• State-wise distribution of population and area in the NER is shown below: Data above indicates that 68 percent of total NE population lives in the state of Assam and the same accounts for 30 percent of total area. Consequently, the population density varies greatly from 17 per sq.km in Arunachal Pradesh to 397 per sq.km in Assam.Some progress has been made in the planning and developmental agenda of the Central and the respective state governments. The government has declared Northeast India as Special Category Region. In addition, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank have initiated various measures for spread of banking and promotion of financial inclusion. Nevertheless, the pace of growth in financial inclusion in NER is still slow. Only one applicant from the entire NER and Eastern India—RGVN Microfinance of Assam—was granted a small finance bank license by the RBI. The region needs more and we should expect more action from both the government and RBI in the near future.The Northeast region has good potential to grow at a rapid pace. Recent data published by CSO (Oct 2014) on State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP) growth rate at constant 2004-05 prices shows that the NER reported strong growth rate. Highest growth was recorded by Meghalaya at 12.41 percent and lowest by Assam (5.87 percent). The five year average SGDP growth rate for most of the NER is around 6 percent, indicating a high growth region. ConclusionFinancial inclusion can play a vital role in the development of the isolated unbanked areas of the country. To strengthen and deepen the financial system, both RBI and the government need to increase financial awareness and invest in basic infrastructure facilities. The government should also consider encouraging NBFCs to expand their operations in this region because they possess the experience and expertise to operate in tougher environments. Manappuram Finance can contribute to the economy of the region to mutual benefit by increasing its exposure in these isolated unbanked areas. Its expert and trained staff can cater to the basic short term financing needs of the local population through Gold Loans. ​Sujit S Kawoor(DGM and Sr. Economist) Previous BlogV.C.

Celebrating a Milestone: 20 Years of Listing on the BSE | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Celebrating a Milestone: 20 Years of Listing on the BSE August 18, 2015NewsManappuram Finance Share By V.P. Nandakumar On November 6, 2016, Manappuram Finance Ltd. celebrated 20 years of listing on the BSE. Mr. V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, looks back at the triumphs and tribulations of those early days in the history of the company. On November 6, 2015, Manappuram Finance Ltd. celebrated 20 years of listing on the BSE with a function at the BSE in Mumbai where I had the honour of ringing the closing bell in the presence of BSE’s MD & CEO, Mr. Ashish Kumar Chauhan. The ringing of the closing bell is a symbolic gesture that brings trading for the day to a close. Historically, Manappuram Finance Ltd. was incorporated in 1992 and our IPO took place in 1995 when we listed on the Cochin, Madras and Bombay stock exchanges. In my address to the audience gathered at the International Convention Centre of the BSE, I talked mostly about our early days, the circumstances in which I came to promote Manappuram Finance, and the troubles we faced in trying to push through its IPO. With twenty years having gone by, I presume it won’t be out of place if I use this opportunity to recall those days once again. I came into gold loans because it was my family business which I took over from my father in 1986 after he passed away. Manappuram was then a one-branch gold loan outfit in Valapad, a coastal village in the Thrissur District of Kerala. My father was very conservative in approach and he believed in keeping things small and manageable. I took over after a stint in the banking sector where I had been exposed to high value loans and advances. I was open to expansion and growth. Business grew rapidly and we established branches in other nearby areas. But then, there were limits to how much I could do with gold loans alone, that too in a proprietary concern. And so, in 1992, I promoted Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Ltd., which later became Manappuram Finance. Our intention was to enter what seemed to be the promising areas of leasing, hire-purchase and general finance. Listing on the BSE Having tasted success with gold loans, my ambitions were sky high. I had grand plans to scale up and expand outwards from our perch in Thrissur. But, it was not long before I ran into rough weather. To put my plans into action, I needed money. I went to the banks but the experience was not happy. Banks were willing to lend to me, but only up to the exact value of my residence that I had to pledge as security. That was when I first began to think of raising money from the stock market. My inspiration was the example of Reliance Industries and Dhirubhai Ambani, a legend even in those days. Manappuram, I decided, would have to list its shares not just at the regional stock exchanges in Cochin and Madras , but also at the biggest and most prestigious, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). It was, of course, easier said than done. The norms for listing on the BSE appeared stringent to a small town outfit like ours. The biggest hurdle was this minimum capital requirement. We had to increase our paid up equity capital from Rs. 50 lakhs to Rs. 1.25 crore to become eligible for a public issue of Rs. 1.75 crore. The first requirement therefore, before we could even think of knocking on BSE’s doors, was to raise Rs.75 lakhs in Thrissur itself. As it happened, raising the capital turned out well in the end, easier than I had thought. Manappuram was by then a name with a history of four decades behind it. There was a reservoir of goodwill for the Manappuram name in the Valapad area that was my father’s legacy, and I was able to tap into it. People who had no idea of the workings of the stock market parted with their hard earned money to invest in our stock. The hurdle of capital was soon crossed and that was how we pushed through our IPO and got listed on the BSE in November, 1995. We became only the second NBFC from Kerala to list on the BSE. Along with capital, we also worked on our governance, and on setting up transparent systems and procedures. Our Board of Directors was revamped with the induction of eminent people. It was headed, initially, by a former Chairman of Nedungadi Bank Mr. Seshadrinathan who was followed by another former Chairman of the same Bank. The then Managing Director of Mathrubhoomi newspaper, Mr. P.V. Chandran, also joined our Board, along with other eminent local businesspersons. Another area of focus was technology and we were pioneers in this area. By the time we approached the BSE, our MIS was fully computerised. We had six branches back then and operations within the branch were also fully computerised. We put in motion the process of getting ourselves credit rated. When ICRA awarded a credit rating of MA to our public deposits in October 1995, just before the listing in November that year, we became the first NBFC in Kerala to be credit rated. Today, in hindsight, I can say listing on the BSE was a beginning, a stepping stone to greater achievements later on. But things did not happen overnight. For over a decade after listing, we kept a low profile. Along the way, there were some troubles as well. Entry into gold loans The CRB scam in 1997 was a wake-up call. As the noose around NBFCs tightened, we were left with a funds crunch, a serious asset liability mismatch. Up until this point of time, Manappuram Finance, the listed company, had kept away from gold loans. That business was carried on, as before, in a proprietary concern. In this moment of crisis, we decided that the listed company too should get into gold loans. And so, Manappuram Finance Ltd. became the first private corporate entity to get into gold loans. That was a game changer. We introduced scale, technology and innovation to an activity that was wholly the preserve of pawnbrokers and moneylenders till then. In technology, we were among the earliest to adopt the “core banking” platform. Unlike the banking sector, there were no ready-made software solutions for gold loans, we developed our own software. In the matter of product innovations too, Manappuram led the way. Gold loans were for long sold as a “one-size-fits-all” product. The company was a pioneer in introducing variety to it, by offering progressively higher loan amounts at higher price points. We were also the first to come up with “one-day interest” where borrowers could settle a gold loan even within the day, at a time when the industry norm was to recover minimum interest for 15 days, or more. Since banks were not comfortable with NBFCs, we had to devise unconventional ways to raise funds. Thanks to ICICI Bank, Manappuram became the first gold loan company to raise finance through the securitization and assignment route. This was in 2005. In December 2007, Manappuram became the first NBFC in Kerala to attract foreign institutional investment when the celebrated PE fund Sequoia Capital invested 70 crore rupees together with Hudson Equity Holdings. When they became convinced about the gold loan story, there was only one listed company in this space, and they did not look elsewhere. Once private equity came in, even the PSU banks were willing to lend to us, and we could shift gears and grow much faster than before. Looking back, I can say with some pride, that in a short span of a decade plus, we were able to transform the face of gold loans, otherwise a very tradition-bound business. No doubt, the fact that gold prices went on an unprecedented bull run for over a decade beginning in 2002 was a heaven sent opportunity. But the larger point I’d like to convey is that Manappuram’s story is more than being at the right place at the right time. Importantly, we held the right tools too. That early listing on the BSE was a major element of this story. It proved its worth when private equity investment flowed into the company and altered the trajectory of its growth. And that was how 6 branches with an AUM of Rs.30 lakhs in 1995—a very humble beginning—has today become 3,500 branches with an AUM of over Rs.10,000 crore ranked among the top 20 NBFCs in India. Looking ahead I have talked at length about gold loans because that was our exclusive business until recently. However, in the days to come, our intention is to become a more diversified NBFC. An increasing share of future business will come from areas like microfinance, commercial vehicle and housing finance, and SME lending. We have already made a promising start and today our new businesses contribute 7 percent of the total business. Over the next three years, that contribution should go up to 25 percent. When we acquired Asirvad Microfinance (an existing MFI) in February this year, it had a portfolio of less than 300 crore. Today, in a little over six months, its business has grown to over Rs.500 crore. And so, if the last two decades were about gold loans, the vision for the next decade sees Manappuram Finance as rooted in gold loans, but with a much broader horizon. Giving shape to this vision is the task we have taken up in earnest.YouTube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJiGrrACLGQ Previous BlogFinancial Inclusion and prospects in the Northeast RegionNext BlogHow to Retain Lost CustomersPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

How to Retain Lost Customers | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. How to Retain Lost Customers September 01, 2015Customer ServiceManappuram Finance Share Everyone says the customer is important, but only a few companies invest the time, effort and financial resources to do what needs to be done to build a more loyal customer base. Executing a clear strategy takes a true understanding of the measures to be taken to bring back the customers and their friends. Companies usually lose from 15% to 20% of their customers annually. Customers leave for many reasons. Some move, some die, some go out of business and some are seduced by the competition. The majority of customers leave because they simply feel company doesn’t care about them or their business. Sounds immature and childish but it’s true. You may care, but if they perceive you don’t, then, in their minds—you don’t Lost Customers-An ignored opportunity Most companies today don’t know how many customers they have lost, much less attempt to bring them back. It is common for a company to lose 15 to 20 percent customers every year. A 5% change in the rate of retention can make a huge difference to the top line and bottom line of the company. No one wants to hear a complaint Most companies won’t try to win back former customers because there may be some pain involved in the process. The process of winning back customers begins with finding out why they left the company. Customer relationships break up for many reasons mostly to do with lack of communication. Set up a Revival Programme Companies can create a group of the most proficient employees. They should be assigned the job of contacting the lost customers with the objective of persuading them to give the company another chance. The plan to counter a low rate of customer retention should include a review of the problem on the lines suggested below: • Cost of acquiring new loyal customer• Annual Marketing and advertising budget• Number of customer complaints each year• System for measuring and tracking problems Call them and ask them why they left It is the best way to find out why they left and attempt to bring them back. Majority of former customers will tell why they left and what can be done to earn their business again. If not at least they will tell what made them so unhappy and company will have an opportunity to correct the problem within the organization. The customers where the possibility of winning back is higher are the ones who were unintentionally pushed away because of issues in the process such as delivery, billing or service problems and those who are pulled away by the competitors who offered them better value. According to the research, the chance of successfully selling to a former customer is higher than the chance of selling to a new prospect. The former customer already knows the company and product or services and the company knows them. There is huge advantage over a competitor as the company have access to their past buying habits. Listen Carefully, ask for their business With attention to detail, to building trust, expressing appreciation, being competent as well as courteous can make the lost customers to come back and thereby bring profit to the company. Communicate with customers and discuss the issues that made them leave. Sometimes it is simple and other times there are real problems that need to be addressed.Never let another customer walk out the door or hang up the phone vowing never to return to our place for business Mrs. Vijayalakshmi M.SAGM, Customer ServiceSeptember 2015 Previous BlogCelebrating a Milestone: 20 Years of Listing on the BSENext BlogA Visit to the Pakalveedu at ThalikulamPost Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

A Visit to the Pakalveedu at Thalikulam | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. A Visit to the Pakalveedu at Thalikulam May 13, 2015Social ServicesManappuram Finance Share It was on New Year’s day of January 1, 2013 that the Manappuram Foundation started “Pakalveedu” (Day Centre) at Thalikulam in association with a local NGO, Thalikkulam Vikas Trust. What the Pakalveedu offers is daylong fellowship to the elderly people living in and around Thalikkulam. The beneficiaries are senior citizens over 65 years of age. The centre works from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. Their day is well spent with activities aimed at their social and intellectual nourishment, as also taking care of their physical health.There are memory games, physiotherapy sessions, songs and activities to promote camaraderie, and regular medical check-ups. The centre provides breakfast, lunch and snacks in the evening free of cost to beneficiaries.At present the Centre has 38 members. The remarkable change that the Pakalveedu has brought about in the last two years is the sight of old people coming out of their loneliness and depression, to lead richer and more fulfilling lives.Yoga instructor Mr. Jamal Conducting Yoga classTour to Peechi Dam commemorating International Day for Older Persons The Pakalveedu is located in the Thalikkulam Rural Apparel Park, at a distance of 2 to 3 kms away from the main highway. I visited the place as part of my study on how beneficiaries perceived this initiative of the Manappuram Foundation. The Foundation provides transport to the beneficiaries picking them up in the morning from nearby locations and dropping them off in the evening. I used the same facility to reach the Centre in the morning. It was a very unusual experience for me to see all these elderly people patiently waiting for the bus at the stops on the way, just like school kids waiting for their school bus. Some of them are seen sitting unable remain standing for long. When the bus arrives, they get up and eagerly clamber on board with the help of the hardworking nurses of the Pakalveedu. In this way, having picked up all the members from all the locations nearby, the bus reaches Pakalveedu. The elders get down slowly from the bus one by one and move towards the Centre.Today, they are excited to see me all of a sudden, more so, when they came to know about the purpose of my visit from the staff. As usual the activities at Pakalveedu commence at 10 o’clock with a prayer. Soon after, one of the female members reads out the newspaper so that everyone can listen and discuss the news, both national and international. During this session everybody express their opinion and concerns. Around 10.30 a.m., all of them head to the dining room for breakfast and then they go back to their respective seats to relax. This is the moment I begin to approach them, one by one, to get a sense of their backgrounds and their perceptions about the Pakalveedu.With great enthusiasm they began to share information about themselves and their experiences at the Pakalveedu. They became talkative and, as someone put it to me, it was like an opportunity to talk to their grandkid. They opened up to me about the sorrows and bitter realities of life. I came across an old father who was a fisherman. I could make out all the infirmities of old age from his face. He shared his life’s experiences like fishing in deep sea channels but now he was unable to go back to sea. His children are not well settled and for that reason he did not feel good about approaching them for his needs. As for what the Pakalveedu experience meant to him, he had no doubt it was a blessing. He was able to get food and essential medical treatment free of cost. He was extremely grateful to the Manappuram Foundation for its efforts.​ A 75 year old mother was eager to tell me her heart-breaking story. She has 3 children but now she has no home to live in. She spends her daytime at the Pakalveedu and her nights at the Guruvayoor temple. Her gratitude towards the Manappuram Foundation was beyond words.Of all the members, the most cheerful was a farmer. I could see he was happy from his words. Every day, he sees off his farm work by about 9 o’clock in the morning and starts preparing for the Pakalveedu visit along with his wife. For him, the most important reason to visit Pakalveedu is to kill boredom, and he treasures the friends he has made and the medical benefits provided here. Occasionally, he brings fresh produce from his farm and has it cooked for the lunch served here. People like him contribute a lot to the friendly and sharing atmosphere of the place.I could not believe my ears when I met this person who started talking to me in English. It turned out, he had passed Senior Cambridge from Colombo. He looked to be a kindly person who did not even wear slippers but his way of talking in English made me wonder. As a young boy of 15 years, he went to Colombo for higher studies. His father was a harbour employee there. He studied at Zahira College, the first Muslim college in Sri Lanka started in 1892. Due to regulations on immigration suddenly imposed during the Second World War, he could not continue in Colombo and was forced to come back to his native place. He started a textile business in Mumbai and employed 8 workers at one time. But now, he is hard-pressed and survives on the earnings of his wife who works in a nearby temple. His three daughters are married and settled in different places. He treasures the facilities provided at the Pakalveedu.Another woman wanted to talk about her daughter-in law’s harsh behavior due to which she was forced to stay separately with her husband. She suffers from several serious ailments and has already gone through a number of surgeries. One day she fainted at home and it was her neighbors who brought her to hospital. After that, as advised by the neighbor, she started coming to Pakalveedu. She had a good impression about the staff working at Pakalveedu.​​​​​Onam celebration at the PakalveeduA common attraction of the Pakalveedu was that the members get care and attention, medical treatment, food, friendship etc. which they don’t find in their own homes. However, for most, it is not really the free food or medicines that matter the most. Instead, it is the relationships, freedom of expression and the feeling of security they treasure the most. The top most priority of the staff is to give care and an opportunity to them to express their views. This is what makes the time they spend at the Pakalveedu the most comforting time of the day. The wellbeing of our senior citizens is the responsibility of society. Manappuram Foundation has shouldered this responsibility through its Pakalveedu project in a most meaningful manner.Subin JosephAsst.EconomistMay, 2015 Previous BlogHow to Retain Lost CustomersNext BlogHow to get a Gold Loan in India?Post Comments Name Email MessagePost Comment Trending Blogs How do we ensure the safety of your Gold in our branches?

How to get a Gold Loan in India? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. How to get a Gold Loan in India? November 30, 2017NewsManappuram Finance Share India is the second-largest consumer of gold in the world, and over the years Indians' enthusiasm for gold has never decreased. The World Gold Council is projected to stay idle with indigenous citizens for about 22,000 tonnes of gold. This has encouraged the government, banks, and NBFCs to actively push gold loans in India and transform them into financial assets. Gold loans are secured credits that commit your gold items to acquire money for your financial requirements and crises. Compared to personal and credit card credits, this is a cheaper loan. Here is all you need to know about gold loans and how to get the best prices. Gold Loan ApplicationThe first step in choosing a loan amount is to apply for a lender's gold loan. There are a number of gold loan companies providing gold loans. Prior to applying for it, you should see and evaluate different gold lenders, such as cheap interest rates, various gold loan schemes, sufficient loan-to-value ratios, flexible tenure, etc. You should select one that matches your requirements.Gold SubmissionYou will have to submit your gold jewellery or coins marked as security or collateral by the gold loan companies. After completing the Gold Loan application form either by way of the online or offline procedure. The most crucial thing to acquire a gold loan is to choose your gold loan scheme. The gold submission cannot be done online. You must remember, you need to visit your individual lender's branch personally to present your gold. You can perform this step in no other manner.Gold EvaluationThe third stage is the gold assessment, now that you have committed your gold to your lender. The first thing that a lender performs is to compute the total worth of its gold when you present your gold jewellery. This value is established by the lender's own internal assessment procedure by the current market value of the gold. This assessment will determine the amount of loan you obtain against your gold jewellery. The bigger your gold worth, the greater the amount your loan will receive. You can obtain up to 90 percent of the gold value as the loan amount, as we have already said. There is another approach by utilizing the Gold Loan Eligibility Calculator to determine how much money is eligible for the Gold Loan. Just provide certain information, such as the weight and purity of gold, and the maximum amount of gold available.Documentation ProcessThe following phase is the documentation once the evaluation procedure has been finished and a definite set of documents must be submitted to the lender. Unlike the tedious paperwork procedure of other loans, one of the primary benefits of a gold loan is low documentation. The needed documentation may be viewed below.Two Recent passport-sized PhotographsIdentify Proof – Aadhar Card/ PAN Card/ Driving Licence/ Voter ID CardAddress Proof – Passport/ Electricity Bill/ Telephone Bill/ Aadhar CardReceipt of your Gold (if asked by the lender) Eligibility, Authentication, and Disbursal The lender will verify your eligibility when all the aforementioned procedures are completed. Every lender has a number of other requirements which must be met by the applicant. These requirements usually relate to the age of the applicant and to the pure ornamentation of gold. A low-CIBIL candidate can also apply for a Gold Loan without any fear of refusal. The lender will confirm all your supplied information as well as the legitimacy of your application papers. The loan amount will be sent into your account after the authentication procedure is completed. These are the phases in the entire process of gold loans. You will not have difficulties applying for a gold loan when you know them.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Get rid of your gold loan problems once and for all December 06, 2022NewsManappuram Finance Share Getting a gold loan rate per gram of your gold at the lowest interest of gold loans is another story compared to the punctual repayment of the loan. A leveraged credit that the consumer obtains from a financial lender, such as a bank or non-banking financial company, on an agreement to repay the gold loan rate per gram along with the interest of gold loan, by pledging their gold items as collateral is known as a loan over your gold treasures.The grade of the gold used as collateral varies from 18 to 24 carats. The majority of gold loan providers are required by law to offer gold loan per gramme rate at a reasonable interest of gold loans. Depending on the gold's existing market worth and grade, the mortgage balance normally measures from 75% to 80% of the gold's worth.Borrowers who want to know the gold loan rate per gram in the current market and the interest of gold loans can use any of the gold loan interest rate calculators available online. Starting at 9%, different lenders who offer gold loan rate per gram of gold valuables charge different rates in the interest of gold loans. Certain lenders additionally impose a small service charge of up to a certain percentage of the gold loan rate per gram amount.Prior to actually applying for a loan, it is usually wise to verify with the lender and evaluate the interest rate, processing fee, late payment costs, and pre-payment expenses. This is an imperative step to take care of to avoid unwanted financial pressure on you throughout the gold loan repayment period.Benefits of taking a gold loan rate gram of your goldWhen it comes to satisfying your short-term financial emergencies, such as paying for an education institution, wedding expenditures, urgent healthcare and treatment, or for any kind of personal usage, a gold loan rate per gram of your gold is comparable to many other available lines of credit. Because a gold loan with an arrangement to repay the gold loan rate per gramme and the interest of gold loans is secured with collateral commitment, minimal documentation is needed.These minimal documentation requirements mean that the mortgage is processed and disbursed more quickly. A gold loan from such a financial lender also allows you the option to utilise the money for any kind of cost because there is no surveillance of the ultimate usage when it comes to the mortgage value of a gold loan. Except for the gold jewellery that has been given, you are not obliged to provide the lender with any further assets as security.Because gold is used as security for these mortgages against your gold, the interest of gold loans is often lower than the interest rates for personal loans. Gold is a largely inactive asset that is rarely utilised to make money. Many Indian households use gold as just an asset or the showcase of their wealth and royalty. Therefore, a gold loan per gramme rate of these gold valuables is the ideal way to obtain cash and utilize the funds while you require it to satisfy your financial obligations.

According to the amounts owed as of the loan payback deadline, the financial lender including banks and non-banking financial companies may impose harsh penalties over the repayment amount and the interest of gold loans.The fee also isn't based on the standard interest of gold loans and fluctuates from 1% to 7%. When a borrower consistently fails to make payments, the financial lender will contact customers on a daily basis with reminders including warnings and notifications via texts, phones, emails, etc.The financial lenders that offer you a gold loan rate per gram of your gold ultimate alternative is to sell your assets at auctions to settle their debts if you ignored frequent warnings or for another reason are incapable of paying it off along with the interest of gold loan arrangements you choose. The lenders seem to have the authority to conduct a foreclosure auction or any form of sale with the gold you pledged in the gold loan arrangement.However, they will let the borrowers know about the auction and the fees associated with the agreement. As per the agreement, many reputed gold loan providers ensure that the borrower receives the extra amount gained with their gold in the auction after subtracting the loan value and interest from the total amount. The lender will deposit any excess selling profits into the consumer's accounts. If the amount is less, financial institutions may file a lawsuit to recoup their debts.The credit score is not a major factor when it comes to the application procedures and eligibility criterion of a gold loan per gramme rate considering the market value of the gold, although failing to repay the mortgage debt has a big effect on the credit score of the borrower. The financial lender that disburses a gold loan at an affordable interest of gold loans will let the credit agencies know about the situation.These authorities will then alert all other lending institutions and banking companies as well. This will prominently form a bruise on a borrower's creditworthiness by affecting his/her credit score. Due to these issues, you won't be able to receive any more loans as a consequence, or if you can, the interest of gold loans will be greater than normal.Factors to know and take care of regarding the repayment of a gold loanConsidering the gold valuables in the form of ornaments or any acceptable form are used as collateral for a gold loan per gramme rate arrangements, one must exercise caution while taking out mortgages against their gold at a lower or higher interest of gold loans and only borrow money that the borrower can readily afford to repay without getting crushed under large financial obligations.Borrowers' credit history, profile, and prospective loan applications may all be cancelled if they fail on the repayment of a gold loan.

However, the mortgage can be foreclosed by repaying the gold loan rate and the interest of gold loans at any time during the tenure.Regarding gold loans, the majority of banks and non-banking financial companies do not impose foreclosure or prepayment fees, however, a handful of financial lenders impose approximately up to 4% of the existing principal loan amount. To find out the methods the lender takes to foreclose and the extra measure you as a borrower should take during the foreclosure, you may always contact them.Know different repayment options in a gold loanBorrowers can choose various repayment options when it comes to the repayment of gold loan rate per gram of their gold and the interest of the gold loan arrangement they choose. Read further to know a few of those and choose the best one regarding your financial circumstances.Pay interest first and the principal laterBorrowers can maintain the principal loan amount and interest of gold loan portions of the loan apart by making regular interest payments.

What most lenders don't tell you about gold loan interest rates | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. What most lenders don't tell you about gold loan interest rates January 09, 2023NewsManappuram Finance Share IntroductionA gold loan is a popular product in India. It is a convenient and easy way to get a loan. However, it’s not that easy to find reliable lenders. You need to do your homework before availing of this loan product so that you don’t end up losing money by defaulting on payments or incurring late fees due to delayed payment cycles. In this article, we will discuss some basic things which should be considered before taking a gold loan so that you don't end up paying more than what was initially promised!Determine the loan-to-value (LTV) ratioThe LTV ratio is a key factor in determining your gold loan interest rate. This number will tell you how much of your property value goes towards paying back the loan, and therefore how much gold loan interest rate you'll have to pay on top of it. The higher this number, the lower your monthly payments will be — but so will your overall cost of borrowing money from a lender. If you're trying not only to save money but also reduce debt loads or pay off credit cards quickly, then using less than 80% LTV may be ideal for increasing those numbers without increasing costs too much (or at all).Check out the company's credit ratingWhen you apply for a gold loan, it's important to check the company's credit rating. A good credit rating means that the lender has been in business for a long time and has proven itself trustworthy. The company should also be accredited by a regulatory body such as FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), so you can rest easy knowing that they'll be around when you have paid the instalments. Finally, if at all possible, try to find out if the lender is giving out loans of this size only to reputable businesses in order to keep their reputation intact—and thus attract more clients like yourself!Compare the gold loan interest rate with othersWhen you compare the gold loan interest rates of different financial institutions, it's important to remember that banks have different rules and regulations. For example, some offer lower rates than others for gold loans with longer terms. If you're looking for a gold loan with the lowest rate possible, make sure your bank or broker is licensed in your state and has been working within its guidelines since opening its doors.The same applies when comparing brokers—they may charge more if they can get away with it! In addition, since each agent works differently from other agents and may have different offices around the country (or world), there may be differences between those two things too: location vs commission rate; how long has this person been in business versus what other clients say about them online forums like Yelp or Facebook reviews; etcetera...The interest rate of gold loans are charged only on the utilised amountThe interest rate of gold loans is charged only on the utilised amount. This means that if you don't use the full amount, you won't be charged interest on the unused portion.For example, if you get a loan of ₹100,000 and only spend ₹50,000 on it in total (your remaining balance is ₹50k), then your monthly interest rate will only be 1% instead of 2%. This is because your outstanding balance was used up before being paid off completely by either buying or selling some stocks/bonds etc., which also lowers your risk exposure when investing in precious metals.Go for a trusted lender and not an unknown oneWhen you're looking for a gold loan, it's important to know that the lender is reputable. You should check out their reputation and make sure they have an established track record of helping borrowers get the money they need. If they are registered with the RBI, this means they're regulated by central banks or governments around the world. In some cases, lenders may also be registered with state authorities as well, which means that these types of companies follow strict ethics codes when providing their services.Know more about gold loan interest rates before you avail of oneThe gold loan interest rate is the amount you have to pay as the interest of gold loan. The higher this number, the more costly it becomes to borrow money from a lender. However, there are some factors that can influence this figure as well. For instance, if you need a large number of funds for buying gold or investing in stocks or shares etc., then these will be charged at higher rates. Also, consider whether or not you plan on using your loan funds immediately after getting them (this will affect how long and how much interest rate of gold loan you'll have to pay). Always Compare your options Finding the best gold loan offer is everyone's goal. Since it depends on the needs of the borrowers, there is no set formula for obtaining one. Before putting their name on the dotted line, one might make sure they weigh all of their possibilities. The first offer you receive might not be the best option for you. As a result, learn all you can about market trends; speak with various banks and financial institutions to learn about their offers; and finally, shortlist a few suitable possibilities. Look for a lender who offers you a loan with a cheaper gold loan interest rate or a larger loan-to-value (LTV) ratio while weighing your options. Lenders like Manappuram Finance Ltfd offer gold loans at affordable interest rates and many other benefits like doorstep gold loans for easy access and to provide a hassle-free environment to their customers.Gold Quality MattersWhen pledging gold ornaments, make sure they meet the minimal purity requirements for eligibility for a loan. Only gold objects that have a purity of 18 to 22 carat or above are approved for loans by creditors. Additionally, while determining the loan value, jewellery with valuable stones embedded in the design will not be taken into account. The loan value will only be determined by the gold's weight and purity. If you are submitting the gold without minimum purity, then the loan amount availed to you will also be different and can be less. So it is our responsibility to buy gold from reputed jewellery.Qualified Form of GoldThe sentimental worth of ornaments is often higher, which may encourage borrowers to make timely loan repayments. As a result, gold jewellery is the preferred form of collateral for creditors in India. For gold loans, banks do not take gold bars or gold bullion. You can get a gold loan against gold coins as long as they are 99.99% pure and under 50 grams in weight. Along with the previously listed considerations, borrowers must fully comprehend the terms and circumstances of their loans. Most lenders do not impose prepayment penalties on gold loans, so if your lender does, try to come to an agreement or find another lender or come to a proper solution.Not knowing the terms of the auctionYour gold will be put up for auction if you are unable to pay back your loan on time. To recover the full loan amount, your lender will be allowed to auction (sell) your gold in the market. Therefore, make an effort to explain the conditions of the auction to your lender and inquire about any connected penalties, so that you can take necessary arrangements and actions to consider retrieving back your gold or other ways to repay your loan. Not taking into account post-sale supportWhen applying for a gold loan, the majority of borrowers overlook after-sales support. It is also one of the most crucial factors that you should take into account. As a result, you should only select gold loan companies or lenders that have a track record of providing friendly customer service. It will enable you to obtain a loan without difficulty as well as proper follow-up and hassle-free services will also be provided from the financier's side. ConclusionIn the end, gold loans are a very good option for some customers but they are not suitable for everyone. Before you decide that you should invest in one, it's always good to know more so that you can make an informed decision. The least expensive type of personal loan is typically a gold loan. Despite this, borrowers should exercise caution and take into account factors such as the loan amount, the purity of the gold item, the length of the loan, the lender's method of calculating the interest rate of gold loan, the borrower's personal credit score, and external benchmarking. The actual interest rate of gold loan rate charged is determined by all of this.Based on several factors related to the borrower, the same lender may charge extremely different rates for the same quantity of gold jewellery pledged as security.

The chances of securing a loan keep decreasing if your CIBIL score keeps falling under a certain range.Does a Gold Loan Impact Your CIBIL Score?Yes, a Gold Loan can affect your CIBIL score. Your credit score is directly impacted by the number and type of credit loans you take out.Taking a Gold Loan can positively or negatively impact your CIBIL score.Applying for a Gold Loan: Your credit score will drop the moment you apply for a Gold Loan.Financial bureaus launch a hard inquiry into your credit record the moment you apply for a loan. The more inquiries, the lower your score gets.Once the financial institutions have examined your credit score, they then decide whether or not you are eligible for a loan.If you want your credit score not to take a negative hit, try not to take too many loans within a short duration.Impact of Credit Mix on Credit Scores: Your credit score is also affected by the nature of the loans you are taking.A good credit mix shows a healthy mix of secured or unsecured loans. Paying your outstanding loans on a timely basis improves your credit score as it shows your sincerity.This positively influences lenders to provide you with a loan on flexible terms.Credit Utilisation Ratio: A credit utilisation ratio is the amount of credit you are taking.

Repayment of Gold Loan on Time: Your CIBIL score is positively impacted by the history of your on-time repayments. Once you take a Gold Loan, you are required to repay the loan amount and interest in the form of monthly EMIs.Paying your EMIs on time improves your chances of subsequent loans.They also encourage a quicker loan approval process, flexible tenures, lower interest rates and more.Loan Default:If you are careless with your loan repayments and keep missing out on your EMIs, your CIBIL score will be affected.This can affect your borrowing conditions the next time you seek out a loan.The Non-Performing Asset will prevent you from taking a loan from any lender if you have not paid your EMIs for three months straight.To prevent such unfortunate occurrences, have a clear conversation with your lender whendrafting the repayment terms of your Gold Loan.How to Ensure a Gold Loan Doesn’t Hurt Your CIBIL ScoreTo ensure a higher credit score, you need to consider the following:Timely Repayment:Make sure you are making all your EMI payments on time. You can choose to pay your EMIs on a monthly basis or at the end of the tenure.Make sure you clearly communicate it properly at the time of taking the loan so that you do not miss out on any payments. Punctuality is the key to improving your CIBIL score.Avoid Defaulting:Defaulting occurs when you fail to make your EMI payments.If you are unable to make a payment, communicate this to your lender to get alternate options that can save your CIBIL score from dropping.Plan Your Finances:Before taking a Gold Loan, carefully assess your financial situation.Check if you are capable of paying back your loan without compromising your basic expenses.Better financial management will prevent you from missing your EMI payments, which will reduce the risk of a lower CIBIL score.ConclusionSo, does a Gold Loan impact your CIBIL score? The answer is yes, it can.However, the impact can be both negative and positive.Thus, you must borrow responsibly and make timely payments towards your Gold Loan to improve your CIBIL score.Always be mindful of how you manage loans to keep your financial future bright.FAQWhat is the minimum CIBIL score for a gold loan?Gold loans do not require a minimum CIBIL score because your pledged gold assets help secure them. This means that even individuals with low/no credit history can get a gold loan.Do you need a good CIBIL score to get a gold loan?You do not need a good CIBIL score to get a gold loan. Since gold loans are secured by the gold you pledge, lenders focus more on the value and purity of the gold than on your credit score.Can I get a gold loan with a bad credit score?Yes, you can obtain a gold loan even if your credit score is low.

Gold Loan: Is It a Secured or Unsecured Loan? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Gold Loan: Is It a Secured or Unsecured Loan? April 24, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share A Gold Loan is one of the most trusted alternatives to secure emergency funds. Not only is the process hassle-free, but the processing of Gold Loans is comparatively faster than traditional loans.A very common question that arises among borrowers is whether a Gold Loan is secured or unsecured. Understanding this will only make it easy for you to make financial decisions.What is a Gold Loan?A Gold Loan involves taking a loan and keeping your gold items as collateral. The loan amount is usually a percentage of the collateral pledged and is applicable only for gold purity ranging between 18-carat to 24-carat.As per the RBI guidelines, only 75% of the current market value of the gold can be provided to the borrower as a loan.It is comparatively easier to secure a Gold Loan than a traditional loan. You need to submit the gold (that you wish to keep for pledging) with the required documents.At Manappuram Finance Limited, officials will examine the gold and suggest the amount they can provide as loan against it. Once the loan is approved, your jewellery will be safe with us till you repay the loan amount. Once the entire loan is repaid, your gold will be released.Borrowers tend to keep their gold items (jewellery, bars, coins) as pledge to fulfil their immediate need for funds, be it for medical, education, business expansion or any other personal needs.Your loan amount is determined by the purity of gold and the amount of gold you are submitting as collateral.Purity in gold is measured in karats. The loan amount is higher for 24-karat gold and keeps decreasing as the purity decreases.Similarly, in the case of weight, only the gold’s weight will be considered. Any stones or metal weight will be excluded.Is a Gold Loan Secured or Unsecured?Gold Loans are considered secured loans. This classification is based on the fact that the borrowers are pledging their physical gold as collateral to secure a loan.This builds confidence among the lenders that in case of a default, they can recoup their loan amount by auctioning the gold.Lower risks on the part of the lender are also evident in the low interest rates of Gold Loans.Borrowers can also benefit from a gold-secured loan. Because the loan is being given against gold, lenders are willing to offer the highest possible loan amount they are permitted to offer for the gold submitted.The approval process for a Gold Loan is also typically faster than that for traditional loans. Traditional unsecured loans require several background checks, which makes the process lengthy.However, with gold-secured loans, the process is much less complicated and requires far less documentation.The presence of gold as collateral also diminishes the importance of the CBIL score. People with low CBIL scores can opt for a Gold Loan just as easily as people with good CBIL scores, which may not be possible in the case of an unsecured loan.At Manappuram Finance Limited, Gold Loans can be secured against gold jewellery. The various types of gold options make it more flexible for a wide number of prospective borrowers.Borrowers can get up to 75% of their pledged gold amount as a loan. Our eligibility criteria for the loan are also relatively simple.You have to be a minimum age of 18 and should possess valid identity and address proof.Why Are Gold Loans Considered Secured?Gold Loans are considered secured loans because a collateral supports the loans. This significantly reduces the risk to the lender.The basic crux of taking a Gold Loan is the borrower pledging their gold to the lender, against which the lender will give them a loan.Since gold is a tangible asset, it provides confidence to the lender that in case there is a default, he can auction the gold to get back the remaining amount.Unlike unsecured loans such as personal loans or credit card advances that hand out loans simply based on the borrowers’ creditworthiness, a tangible asset backs a gold-secured loan that reduces the lenders' risk of suffering from the loss of default payments.A gold-secured loan is one of the most common ways to meet emergency expenditures. They carry low interest rates, flexible terms and conditions, and a hassle-free and fast approval process.The eligibility criteria for a Gold Loan are also simpler. Instead of being judged on the basis of their CBIL score or income, the loan amount is determined based on the gold being submitted.This makes it accessible to all who can use the money to pay their education or medical bills or fund their business.ConclusionSo, when asked if a Gold Loan is secured or unsecured, the answer is that it is a secured loan. By giving your gold as collateral, you can borrow money with better terms.FAQHow do I know if my loan is secured or unsecured?A loan is secured if you pledge collateral, like gold or property, to guarantee repayment.If no collateral is involved, the loan is unsecured.Which loan is better, secured or unsecured?Secured loans are generally better because they offer lower interest rates, higher borrowing limits, and flexible repayment terms, thanks to the collateral you provide.While unsecured loans do not risk your assets, they usually feature higher interest rates and lower loan amounts.Is a gold loan safe or not?A gold loan is safe if you choose reputable lenders. At Manappuram Finance Limited, we store your gold in a strong vault/room, insure it for full value and employ electronic surveillance systems to ensure the security of your pledged assets.

How to Avoid Common Mistakes While Taking a Gold Loan? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. How to Avoid Common Mistakes While Taking a Gold Loan? April 25, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Tough financial spots can be overwhelming. When unexpected bills and expenses start to pile up, it is easy to feel like you are burdened by continuous debt. Gold loans can be a lifeline in these situations. They offer quick access to cash, which can be a huge relief when you are struggling financially and require support.However, if not approached responsibly, Gold Loans can lead to more financial headaches down the line. This makes it important to keep yourself informed about the common mistakes people make when taking a Gold Loan.Today, we will uncover some common mistakes to avoid and provide valuable insights about Gold Loan to help you make an informed decision.Mistakes to Avoid While Taking a Gold LoanMistake #1: Not Checking the Interest RateTo know all about Gold Loan, you must be aware of the interest rate on your Gold Loan. Proceeding without this information is like signing a blank check. You might be in for a surprise, such as a loan that is more expensive after interest rates.A tiny difference in interest rates can add up to a big amount over time.For example, if you borrow ₹1 lakh for 1 year at 12% interest, you will pay ₹12,000 in interest. But if you borrow the same ₹1 lakh at 15% interest, your interest payout jumps to ₹15,000.That is an extra ₹3,000 out of your pocket.How to Avoid?Compare interest rates offered by multiple lenders to choose the one that aligns with your needs.Check how different lenders calculate interest. Do they calculate the interest on the daily outstanding balance in the loan account?Look beyond the interest rate and consider additional information about Gold Loans, such as associated fees and other charges.Mistake #2: Not Reading the Loan AgreementNot reading the fine print on your Gold Loan agreement can be a costly mistake. If you do not check the details about Gold Loans thoroughly, you might miss hidden fees like processing fees, late payment charges or prepayment penalties. Or you might not grasp the risks to your precious gold collateral if you default.How to Avoid?Read the agreement carefully, clause by clause.Ask questions and clarify any doubts with the lender.Search for hidden information about Gold Loans (including charges) and assess all the costs involved before making the final decision.Mistake #3: Not Checking the Loan-to-Value (LTV) RatioThe LTV ratio determines the amount you can borrow against your gold assets. The higher the ratio, the more you can borrow.Not checking this detail about Gold Loans can leave you with a loan that is less than you expected.For instance, for ₹1 lakh worth of gold, a 60% LTV ratio gets you ₹60,000, but an LTV ratio of 75% lets you borrow ₹75,000. Based on this, you could be earning ₹15,000 extra.How to Avoid?Compare LTV ratios from different lenders to find the best deal.Do not skip the details. Understand the LTV ratio and other terms.Use a Gold Loan Calculator to calculate how much you can borrow.Mistake #4: Not Considering the Repayment TermsRepayment terms can be a hidden trap. If you are not careful about Gold Loans, you might end up with:Surprise fees that blow your budget.Repayment schedules that are not flexible.Higher interest rates that can make your loan more expensive.How to Avoid?Know the details about Gold Loans, such as loan tenure, interest rate and EMIs.Opt for lenders offering flexible repayment plans, such as bullet payments or part payments.Choose lenders with a responsive customer support team, such as Manappuram Finance Limited.Mistake #5: Not Checking the Lender's ReputationChoosing the right lender is the foundation of a successful Gold Loan experience. Not researching about the Gold Loan lenders can lead to unwanted consequences, such as a debt trap, high interest rates and inflexible repayment plans.How to Avoid?Check online reviews, ratings and testimonials from previous customers.Ensure the lender is certified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), such as Manappuram Finance Limited.Verify that the lender has a physical presence, like branches or offices.Evaluate how responsive, knowledgeable and helpful their customer support team is before making the final decision.ConclusionTaking a Gold Loan can be a lifesaver when you need cash quickly, but it is essential to steer clear of certain mistakes that can turn financial aid into a headache.By being mindful of these common pitfalls and information about Gold Loans, you will be able to navigate the Gold Loan process with confidence and ease.So, do your research, read the details about Gold Loan carefully and choose a trustworthy lender like Manappuram Finance Limited.With a little caution and diligence, you can unlock the value of your gold jewellery or ornaments and achieve your financial goals without much hassle.FAQHow can I prepare myself before applying for a gold loan?To prepare for a gold loan, gather identity and address proofs, a bank passbook (if needed), and your passport-size photographs.You must also have your gold assets ready for quick verification and smooth processing.How do I check my gold loan details?To check your gold loan details, you will have to download your lender’s official app.For instance, if you have taken a loan with Manappuram Finance Limited, download the Manappuram Gold Loan OGL Lite app on your smartphone, log in, and select “View Account Details”.Are online gold loans riskier than offline ones?No, online gold loans are not riskier than offline ones. Both options offer strong security measures for your gold.In fact, online loans offer added convenience and faster processing without increasing risk.

How to Use a Gold Loan for a Medical Emergency: A Simple Guide | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us.

How to Use a Gold Loan for a Medical Emergency: A Simple Guide April 25, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Medical emergencies can strike out of the blue and can be a huge strain on your finances. If you are in such a situation, an instant Gold Loan is a great way to attain emergency funds without hefty documentation and requirements. With a Gold Loan, you can easily borrow against your possessed gold jewellery or other assets and attend to a medical emergency faster.Why Consider a Gold Loan for a Medical Emergency?Medical emergencies create a significant financial burden on the family. If you need quick access to funds, an instant Gold Loan is one of the most trustable and hassle-free methods of securing it.Quick Access to Funds: In case of a medical emergency, timing is essential. Unsecured loans take a long time to process and have a long list of rigid criteria and a longer processing time.This makes it almost impossible to access emergency funds at the time of crisis. With a Gold Loan, however, the process requires less time and effort.This quick access to funds makes a Gold Loan for emergencies a smart alternative.High CIBIL Score is Not Mandatory: Regular, unsecured loans for emergencies require borrowers to have a high CIBIL score. Lenders use the score to determine creditworthiness.Having a CIBIL score of 700 and above is considered ideal for securing a loan.In the case of a Gold Loan, however, the loan is being taken against collateral, making your CIBIL score a less impacting factor in determining the loan amount.Flexible Loan Amounts: The amount of money you can borrow in a Gold Loan depends on the type, quality, and quantity of gold assets you can offer.As per RBI guidelines, financial institutions can offer up to 75% of the collateral value as the loan amount.Hence, your loan amount predominantly depends on how much collateral you can pledge to the lender, making it a more flexible option for emergencies.Lower Interest Rates: Gold Loans typically carry lower interest rates than traditional loans.The presence of collateral greatly affects the final loan amount and applicable interest rates. These low rates reduce the financial burden of repayment.Flexibility in Type of Gold: You can acquire a Gold Loan against different types of gold assets. You can pledge not only gold ornaments but also gold coins and bars.Gold coins should not weigh more than 50g and should be authorised by the government or should be bought from a recognised bank or jeweller.Loan-To-Value Ratio: A loan-to-value ratio is the amount of money a lender can provide you against your pledged collateral.Manappuram Finance Limited offers up to 75% of the current market rate on your pledged gold jewellery as your loan amount.Minimal Documentation: Typically, a Gold Loan application requires minimum documentation to provide quick funds.For instance, lenders like Manappuram Finance Ltd. only require a copy of your identity proof, address proof, etc.With this need for minimum documentation, the application process becomes simpler and faster, ensuring you get access to the required funds instantly to handle the medical emergency.How Does a Gold Loan Work?Secured loans: The first step in securing a Gold Loan is submitting your gold as collateral. Pledge your gold to the lender based on a loan amount, and interest rates will be calculated. Make sure of two things:The purity of the gold is between 18K and 24K.You are the owner of the gold you are pledging as collateral.Type of Gold Accepted: Check the gold assets that are acceptable to your chosen lender. At Manappuram Finance Ltd., we accept jewellery as collateral. This flexibility makes it easier for people to obtain Gold Loans during emergencies.Maximum Loan-To-Value Ratio: As mentioned above, the maximum LTV permitted by RBI is 75% of the collateral submitted. So, the amount you will receive in a Gold Loan for emergency will be up to 75% of the current market value of the gold you are pledging.Eligibility and Documentation: The eligibility and documentation criteria for a Gold Loan are much less rigid than those for a traditional loan. In order to secure a Gold Loan at Manappuram Finance, you must be at least 18 years of age and possess a valid proof of identity and address.Credit Approval: Once you have pledged your gold and submitted all the documents, the lender evaluates your gold and Gold Loan application. At the end of the approval process, the borrower receives the loan amount in their registered bank account.Steps to Get a Gold Loan for Medical ExpensesThe process to avail an instant Gold Loan is very simple and involves a straightforward process:Collect your gold items.You can apply to us either online or at your nearest Manappuram Finance Ltd. branch.Submit the gold along with the documents mentioned.Our officials at the counter will measure your gold and check its purity.Based on the evaluation, a loan amount will be stated to you.If you are okay with the amount being offered, you will have to sign the agreement papers. The agreement paper will also mention the tenure and the rate of interest for the loan.Once the paperwork goes through, you will receive the loan amount in your registered bank account.Other Options in Loans for EmergenciesWhile a Gold Loan for emergencies makes a compelling case, you can also opt for a secured personal loan or a digital personal loan.They may carry a comparatively higher rate of interest, but the application process is simpler, with minimum documentation and charges.You can take a personal loan for any kind of emergency—from attending to a medical emergency to boosting your business to arranging funds to get married, the Manappuram Finance Ltd. Personal Loan for an emergency helps meet a wide range of your financial needs.ConclusionWhen a medical emergency arises, quickly securing funds is crucial. Using a Gold Loan can provide the immediate financial support you need.With lenders like Manappuram Finance Ltd. offering instant Gold Loans, you can focus on getting the necessary medical care without added financial stress.FAQCan I get a gold loan approved quickly during a medical emergency?Yes.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. Gold Loan vs Personal Loan: Which Loan is Best? May 21, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Life can be unpredictable, and sometimes, people need a financial safety net to fall back on. When emergencies strike, two popular forms of finance come to mind: Gold Loans and Personal Loans.Although they both may serve the purpose of providing quick funds, there are a few major differences between a Gold Loan and a Personal Loan, and it can be confusing to decide which loan is the best for you.This article will explain the pros and cons of each option so you can make a smart decision that meets your financial needs and confidently navigate life's ups and downs.Personal Loan vs. Gold Loan: Which Loan is Best for Your Needs?Choosing between Gold Loans and Personal Loans depends on your unique financial situation.If you are looking for a loan with minimal documentation, a low credit score requirement or need some quick cash for a short-term expense, a Gold Loan might be the way to go. The process is usually faster and requires less paperwork. Plus, you do not need a high credit score.On the other hand, if you are looking for a larger loan to cover a large purchase, such as a wedding, education expenses, home renovation or other major expenses, a Personal Loan might be a better fit.Gold Loan: A Brief OverviewA Gold Loan is a secured loan that provides you with financial assistance by keeping gold as a collateral. It requires you to use your gold jewellery, coins or ornaments as collateral to secure a loan.The lender assesses the value of your gold and offers you a loan amount based on the accumulated value. You then repay the loan with interest over a set period. Once you have paid off the loan, your gold is returned to you.Personal Loan: A Brief OverviewPersonal loans are another type of financing option that provides a lump sum of money for various purposes, such as weddings, medical emergencies or home renovations.Personal loans can be secured or unsecured. If you choose a secured loan, you will need to put up collateral, such as your house or car, to guarantee repayment.But if you go for an unsecured loan, you will not have to put up any collateral. However, with unsecured loans, you will likely face higher interest rates and stricter credit requirements. Difference Between Gold Loan and Personal LoanFeatureGold LoanPersonal LoanInterest RatesGold Loans are generally the more affordable option as they come with lower interest rates.Personal Loans interest rates can be significantly higher than Gold Loans.Collateral RequirementsYou must pledge your gold as collateral. The collateral can be your gold jewellery, coins, or bars.If you default, the lender has the right to seize the collateral and recover the balance loan amount.For secured Personal Loans, borrowers may need to provide collateral, such as property, investments or any other asset.However, unsecured personal loans require no collateral. Instead, lenders rely on your credit history, income and other factors to assess your creditworthiness.Credit Score DependenceGold Loans do not rely on credit scores or credit history.Credit scores heavily influence Personal Loans.Repayment TenureTypically, it ranges from a few days to a year.Personal Loans can have a much longer tenure, from 24 months to 240 months.Maximum Disbursal AmountGold loans are disbursed up to a certain percentage of the gold's value.This amount varies across lenders. For example - Manappuram Finance Limited offers Gold Loans of up to ₹5 crores.Personal loan disbursal amounts are often capped at a relatively lower value, usually up to ₹40-₹50 lacs.EligibilityGold loans have relatively relaxed eligibility norms. Lenders typically require borrowers to be at least 18 years old and own the gold being pledged as collateral.Personal Loans have stricter eligibility criteria, with lenders usually requiring borrowers to have a minimum income level, a good credit score, and a stable employment history.Loan-to-Value RatioHigherComparatively lowerSuitabilityGold Loans are ideal for short-term financial requirements. They are also suitable for individuals who have a low credit score or limited credit history.Personal Loans are better suited for larger financial needs.They are also a good option for individuals who want to consolidate debt or improve their credit score.Ending NotesAt first glance, both these loans might seem similar, but they are quite different. Understanding the difference between Gold Loan and Personal Loan will help you make an informed decision tailored to your unique financial needs.Get your Gold Loan from Manappuram Finance Limited and benefit from lower interest rates, instant disbursal, minimum documentation and flexible tenure.By doing so, you can choose a loan that perfectly matches your needs, goals and financial aspirations.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. What Happens If You Can't Repay Your Gold Loan on Time: An Awareness Guide May 30, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Summary: If you fail to repay your gold loan on time, you may face penalties, a drop in your credit score, and risk losing your pledged gold via auction. Persistent default can even lead to legal action. To avoid these consequences, communicate early with your lender, explore repayment options like interest-only or bullet payments, use savings if possible, or seek expert financial advice. Acting quickly can help protect both your credit and your gold.A gold loan is a way to borrow money to meet your immediate financial needs. The simple eligibility criteria and fast approval process have resulted in its immense popularity in recent years. Moreover, the presence of collateral provides confidence to the lender.Once the loan amount has been repaid, the borrower can take back the gold pledged.However, in some cases, people find it difficult to pay back the money on time. In such cases, they are met with consequences ranging from penalty charges to the auctioning of jewellery.Gold Loan Non-Repayment: What Happens If You Don’t Pay Back A Loan?Penalty:Missing gold loan payments can be stressful and costly. If you are late in servicing the interest due, you will face penal charges of up to 2% per year on top of your original loan rate. These charges kick in after the normal loan period ends, which is usually between 3 months to a year. The penal charges are applicable to the entire outstanding amount until actual payment.Auctioning of Gold Collaterals:One of the biggest consequences of not repaying your loan on time is losing the gold assets you used as collateral for taking a gold loan.If you are unable to repay your loan, lenders may work with you to find a solution. However, if there is no response after sufficient notice and periodic SMS reminders, steps will be taken to recover the losses. This involves selling your pledged gold through an auction after intimation.The proceeds from the auction will first be used to cover your outstanding loan amount, interest, and penalties. If there is any excess, it will be adjusted against any other debts you may owe. Any remaining surplus will be refunded to you within 30 days of the auction.But if the auction amount still falls short, the lender may take further action (like legal proceedings) to recover the remaining amount.Legal Actions:In severe cases of non-repayment, legal actions can also be taken against the borrower. While this happens in the most unfortunate and rarest conditions, the risk of it looms in the picture. Legal actions will only dampen your reputation and credit history and cost you more money.Impact on Your Credit Score:The CIBIL score is not very important when opting for a gold loan. However, in case of default, your credit history will show the records of your delayed or non-repayment of your loan. This can lower your CIBIL score.5 Solutions If You Can’t Repay or Manage RepaymentsCommunication is Key:If you anticipate a delay in your loan repayment, it is crucial to communicate this to your lender promptly. This proactive step can help you and the lender find a solution that avoids any negative repercussions.Our team at Manappuram Finance Ltd. is here to work with you, whether it is adjusting the terms or finding a more flexible repayment plan.Our team at Manappuram Finance Ltd. is here to work with you, whether it is adjusting the terms or finding a more flexible repayment plan.Interest Servicing:You can opt to pay the interest monthly and repay the principal amount when the loan matures. This way, you will be able to break down your gold loan repayments into manageable chunks and avoid a big financial hit all at once.Single Repayment/Bullet Repayment:Another convenient repayment option for gold loans is single repayment. This alternative lets you pay off your gold loan with one easy instalment on the maturity date. Thanks to this, you can enjoy the freedom of not worrying about monthly payments.Use Savings:If you are unable to repay your debt through your salary, consider using your savings. This will help you pay off your outstanding loan amount and also prevent the risk of losing your gold or incurring heavy penalty charges.Take Advice from Experts:Talking to a financial advisor can help you understand the financial options that are available to you to manage your debt. They can also help you find solutions to use your money wisely.Conclusion Not making your gold loan repayment on time can lead to extra charges, lower your credit score, loss of your gold, legal issues, and other financial problems.It's crucial to act quickly and talk to your lender if you are having trouble paying.By exploring different solutions and seeking advice from financial experts, you can find a way to manage your loan and keep your valuable gold safe.FAQWill not repaying my gold loan affect my credit score?Yes, not repaying your gold loan will negatively affect your credit score. This is because the default is reported to credit bureaus, making it harder for you to get loans in the future.Can I talk to the lender if I’m unable to repay the gold loan on time?Yes. If you are having trouble repaying your gold loan on time, you can contact your lender. They can help you by extending or renewing your loan, so you can avoid penalties and keep your gold safe.Is an unpaid loan a criminal case in India?Gold loan default in India is usually a civil matter and does not result in criminal charges. If you are unable to repay your loan, the lender will auction your pledged gold to recover the outstanding amount after giving you sufficient notice.If the auction proceeds fall short of covering the loan, the lender can take legal action to recover the remaining balance, which may involve a civil lawsuit but not criminal prosecution.

What Types of Gold Are Eligible for a Gold Loan | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. What Types of Gold Are Eligible for a Gold Loan: An Expert Guide May 30, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Summary: You can get a gold loan by pledging BIS-hallmarked jewellery or bank-issued gold coins. The loan amount depends on purity, weight, market price, and LTV (max 75%). Gold bars, plated, low-purity, mixed-metal, or undocumented gold are not eligible as per RBI guidelines.Gold loans are a popular alternative to traditional loans for acquiring urgent funds. People choose gold loans because they are easy to get, and the application process is also hassle-free.It’s important to know the various types of gold that you can use for these loans. This guide will help you understand the types of gold required for a gold loan and what factors affect your gold loan eligibility.Types of Gold Required for a Gold LoanWhen you want to get a gold loan, lenders usually accept certain kinds of gold items. Here are the main types:Gold Jewellery: Gold jewellery or ornaments are some of the most widely accepted items for a gold loan. This includes items like rings, necklaces, bangles, earrings, etc. The value of your gold jewellery is determined by its gold content, which is usually measured in carats. The higher the carat rating, the more valuable the gold. As per the latest RBI draft guidelines, only gold jewellery and ornaments with a minimum purity of 22 carats are eligible for a gold loan.Gold Coins: Gold coins are also accepted by some lenders for gold loans except Manappuram Finance Limited. However, with gold coins, the conditions are a bit more rigid. If you are thinking of using gold coins as collateral, it is a good idea to check with the lender first to see what their exact requirements are and how they will value your coins.Hallmark Gold: Hallmark Gold is certified by the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards). This type of gold is preferred by lenders because it boasts a mark of quality that makes it legally compliant and a verified form of gold.Types of Gold Not Eligible for a Gold LoanNot all gold items meet the gold loan eligibility requirements. Here are some common types that usually do not qualify to serve as collateral for a gold loan:Gold-Plated Jewellery: Jewellery that is gold-plated or has a thin layer of gold over another base metal is not accepted by reputable lenders, such as Manappuram Finance Limited.Low Purity Gold: The purity of gold jewellery is measured in karats. Manappuram Finance Ltd. does not accept any gold jewellery, bars, or coins that are below 18-karat in purity.Gold Without Proper Documentation: If the gold assets you pledge do not have proof of their purity, they may not be accepted. Non-hallmarked jewellery often gets rejected if it fails to meet the purity standards set by the lenders.Mix Metals: Jewellery made from a mix of multiple metals might often be rejected if the gold percentage does not match the purity standard of 18-carat to 24-carat gold.Gold with Stones: Jewellery items that carry more stones than gold in weight are usually not accepted by us. They are rejected because valuing them is challenging.Gold Bars: According to the new RBI guidelines, gold bars are no longer an acceptable asset for obtaining a gold loan. The new guidelines clearly state that lenders cannot approve gold loans for primary gold, including gold bars.Factors that Influence the Gold Loan AmountHere are the main factors that affect gold loan eligibility:Purity of Gold: The purer the gold, the higher the loan amount. Manappuram Finance Limited offers gold loans against gold assets with a purity ranging from 18-carat to 24-carat. If you want to acquire a higher loan amount, consider pledging gold with high purity. In this way, even if you are pledging less jewellery in grams, the purity can compensate for it.Gold Weight: The weight of the gold also affects the loan amount you can receive against your collateral. More gold weight also means higher gold value. However, it is to be noted that the loan will only be provided for the amount of gold in it and not for its added stones and metals.Gold Price in the Market: Gold prices are volatile and subject to constant change. The loan amount you receive will be based on the current market price of gold. If you can wait, opt for a loan when the price of gold is rising to receive the best amount against your collateral.Lender’s Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: The Loan-to-Value Ratio determines the amount of money a lender can provide against gold. The LTV ratio has been fixed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Lenders are allowed to hand out up to 75% of the pledged gold’s value.ConclusionYou can pledge your gold for a loan to meet urgent financial needs while keeping your assets secure. However, understanding the types of gold required for a gold loan and the factors affecting your loan eligibility is important before you apply.Lenders usually accept gold jewellery and certain gold coins, but not items like gold-plated ornaments or low-purity gold. Furthermore, the amount you can borrow depends on the purity and weight of your gold, the current gold price, and the lender's LTV ratio.By knowing these details, you can make better decisions and get the most value from your gold assets when you need financial help.FAQCan I get a gold loan on 24-carat gold?Yes, you can easily get a gold loan on 24-carat gold. Reputable lenders, such as Manappuram Finance Limited, accept gold with a purity between 18 and 24 karats, provided you are the actual owner of the gold.Is a gold bar accepted for gold loans?No. According to the latest RBI guidelines, lenders are not allowed to grant loans against primary gold, which includes gold bars, bullion, blocks, slabs, billets, shots, pellets, rods, sheets, foils, and wires.Is Hallmark Gold preferred for gold loans?Yes, hallmark gold is preferred for gold loans because it guarantees verified purity between 18 and 24 karats. This helps ensure accurate valuation and a transparent, trustworthy process for customers.

What is the Minimum Weight Required for a Gold Loan? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content BlogRead our blogs for expert insights, tips, and strategies to empower your financial journey with us. Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. What is the Minimum Weight Required for a Gold Loan? May 30, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Summary: This guide explains the minimum gold weight required to apply for a gold loan, which varies by lender and can be as low as 1 gram. It covers key factors affecting loan eligibility, including gold purity (18 to 24 karats), weight, current market price, and the RBI-mandated loan-to-value ratio of up to 75%. Understanding these elements helps you make informed decisions and secure the best loan against your gold assets.If you are thinking of taking a gold loan, there is something important to know: the minimum gold weight for gold loans.It is not just about owning gold; lenders have specific rules on the quantity and purity required to approve a loan. This requirement can vary from one lender to another, so it is essential to get it right.This article will highlight what you need to know about the gold loan minimum weight requirement and how it affects your loan application.By understanding this, you will be better prepared to apply for a gold loan.Minimum Gold Weight for Gold LoansGold loans can be a real lifesaver, but the gold loan minimum weight requirement can be a major hurdle.The thing is, different lenders have different rules, so it is not always straightforward.Some lenders have strict rules about how much gold you need to provide to borrow funds. However, at Manappuram Finance Limited, we offer gold loans starting from as low as ₹3,000 to ₹1.5 crore.And if you are looking for even more funding, you can get a loan of more than ₹1.5 crore with a special approval.As long as your gold is within the specified karat range, i.e., 18-24 karats, you are eligible for a gold loan.Plus, we offer a high Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of up to 75%. This lets you get a decent amount of cash by pledging your gold assets.For example, if the current rate of gold in the market is ₹93,645 for 10g of gold. For 1.5g of gold, the price will be ₹14,046.75.Since the LTV ratio goes up to 75%, the maximum you can receive for your 1.5g of 24-karat gold is ₹10,535.06.Factors That Determine the Loan AmountPurity of Gold: It is very important to determine the quality of gold. The purity of the gold is measured in karats, with 18-karats being the least and 24-karat being the highest level of purity. The higher the purity of the gold pledged, the higher the loan amount.Renowned lenders, such as Manappuram Finance Limited, accept gold items in the range of 18 K-24 K. Gold below 18K does not meet the purity standards.Weight of Gold: The weight of gold is another factor that decides your gold loan amount. The greater the quantity of gold, the higher the amount of loan you can secure.Current Market Price of Gold: The price of gold is subject to change. Lenders provide you with the eligible loan amount as per the current price of gold in the Indian market. This means that the amount you can borrow against your gold can change depending on the current market price of gold. If the price of gold goes up, the value of your gold goes up, too, and you might be eligible for a bigger loan. On the other hand, if the price of gold drops, the value of your gold decreases, and you might not be able to borrow as much. So, if you can afford to wait, pledge your gold for a loan when there is a steep rise in the market price of the gold.Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: The LTV ratio determines the amount of money you can receive for your pledged gold. As per the Reserve Bank of India guidelines on gold loans, lenders can give you up to 75% of your gold's value. For example, if the LTV is 75% and your gold is worth ₹1,00,000, you can get up to ₹75,000 as a loan. The loan amount will be provided only for the gold component of your item and not for any stones or other metals included.Creditor’s Margin: Different lenders have different regulations and margins that they deduct from the gold value. The creditor’s margin is supposed to cover the lender’s risk and administrative costs incurred during the gold valuation process. When you pledge your gold, the creditor's margin impacts how much funds you get, as the loan amount is provided to you after deducting all these charges.Type of Gold: The type of gold you are pledging also influences your loan amount. Not all financial institutions accept all types of gold. While Manappuram Finance Limited accepts only gold ornaments, and a lot of financial institutions refuse to consider coins and bars as they find it difficult to prove purity.

Discover a wealth of knowledge about gold loans. What is the Typical Duration of a Gold Loan? May 30, 2025NBFC Gold Loan Share Summary: Gold loan durations typically range from as short as 1 day to 12 months, depending on the lender and the loan scheme chosen. Some banks may offer longer tenures up to 24 or even 36 months for specific schemes. Repayment can be made in a lump sum or bullet payments, and some lenders allow tenure extensions if needed. Always confirm terms with your lender to choose the best option for your needs.A gold loan is a way to borrow money by pledging your gold items, such as jewellery, coins, and more, to a financial institution or an individual lender. The lender holds your gold safely while you repay the loan amount, including the interest.When applying for a gold loan, one of the key things to consider is the loan tenure. This is because the right gold loan tenure allows the borrowers to accumulate the funds required to release their pledged assets.Different lenders provide gold loans with different tenures. So, to help you make a smart choice, this blog will take a look at the typical gold loan duration.What is the Minimum Tenure on a Gold Loan?The gold loan minimum tenure can vary depending on the lender. For example, Manappuram Finance Limited offers gold loans with a short minimum tenure of just 1 day. This means you can repay your gold loan within a day of taking it.In such cases, borrowers like Manappuram Finance Limited are charged interest for only a day. This flexibility intrigues customers who can repay the loan and release their collateral whenever they have enough funds to clear their loan.But keep in mind that the tenure of your gold loan depends on the specific loan scheme you choose. Hence, it is always advisable to check with your lender on their gold loan minimum tenure before opting for one. This clarity helps you make better financial decisions.What is the Maximum Tenure on a Gold Loan?Just like the minimum tenure, the gold loan maximum tenure also differs from lender to lender.While some lenders give you a shorter period to settle your loan, others, such as Manappuram Finance Limited, let you take up to 1 year to repay the loan.You can either pay back the loan in one go or break it down into smaller. This flexibility is a lifesaver, especially when unexpected expenses pop up.By spreading out your payments, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed and stay on top of your finances.Can You Extend The Gold Loan Tenure?Manappuram Finance Limited lets you extend the due date of your loan on your request. You can get up to 90 extra days to pay back your loan.Thanks to this facility, you can get much-needed time to sort out your finances and get back on your feet without the constant stress of an overdue loan looming over you.Factors Affecting Gold Loan TenureLoan Amount: The amount you borrow can affect your loan tenure. If you are borrowing a hefty amount, you can opt for a longer repayment period if the lender provides that option.Lender’s Policies: Different financial institutions have different policies regarding gold loan duration. Some lenders offer a rigid gold loan minimum tenure, while others are flexible. Similarly, the maximum tenure also varies from lender to lender.Higher Interest Rates: Higher interest rates make long-term borrowing costlier. Hence, lenders may offer shorter loan tenures to help you manage the overall repayment burden.Repayment Plan: Your repayment plan also affects your loan tenure. You can opt to pay for your loan in one lump sum (on maturity) or by bullet payments to manage your payments better.ConclusionUnderstanding the typical gold loan duration is important when you are planning to borrow money using your gold as security.Different lenders have different rules about how short or long this period can be. To avoid any surprises, it is essential to talk to your lender and understand their specific terms before taking a gold loan. This way, you can choose a loan that fits your needs and repayment ability.FAQWhat is the expiry date of a gold loan?The expiry date of a gold loan at Manappuram Finance Limited is usually 365 days from the date of disbursement. However, if you wish to repay your gold loan early, you can do so without any prepayment penalties. In case you need more time, you can talk to Manappuram Finance Limited about renewing or extending your loan before the expiry date.Can I extend the tenure of my gold loan?Yes, you can extend the tenure of your gold loan by reaching out to your lender.Can I repay my gold loan in installments?Yes, you can repay your gold loan in easy monthly installments. Manappuram Finance Limited lets you choose a convenient day each month for installment payments, covering both the interest and principal.

Speaking on the occasion, Shri Pranab Mukherjee said that the former prime minister had provided stability to India and successfully presided over the country’s finances during troubled times.

He also mentioned how a money lending and pawn broking business by its founder V.C. Padmanabhan has now adapted to change and transformed itself into one of India’s leading NBFCs under the leadership of Shri. V.P. Nandakumar. In his welcome speech, Shri V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance Ltd. mentioned that while Manappuram had remained a single branch business present only in Valapad under its Founder, Shri V.C.

They are presented every year to eminent personalities who have made significant contributions in the categories of Arts and Literature, Civil Servant achieving Excellence in Public Administration, Public Representative achieving Excellence in Good Governance, Business Excellence leading to development of Society at large and Ecology and Environment Conservation.

Padmanabhan Memorial Annual Lecture delivered by Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NIti Aayog, on the topic “Transforming India.” Watch Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It-SE--yvQ8&t=4785sShri Kant spoke about the need to step up India’s economic growth rate in order to emerge as a developed country in the shortest time. He pointed out that wealth creation is primarily a function of the private sector and therefore the need of the hour is to make it easy for the private sector to function effectively. However, the Indian experience historically has been that we have made India a complicated, complex and difficult country for the private sector to do business. Accordingly, the focus of the government of India now is to improve the ease of doing business in the country and over the last three years, a lot has been done in this regard. The introduction of GST, the passing of the bankruptcy law, the scrapping of over 11,000 outdated laws, and the practice of ranking states on the basis of ease of doing business are all recent measures to improve the climate for private sector activity in India, he said.Earlier, Shri Amitabh Kant was introduced by Shri B.N. Raveendra Babu, Executive Director, Manappuram Finance Ltd. Shri Sooraj Nandan, Senior Vice President of the company, delivered the vote of thanks.

After Manappuram’s Project E-Valapad, Village Declared Fully E-Literate March 23, 2017Valapad, ThrissurImage Valapad village in the Thrissur District of Kerala was officially declared as a fully e-literate village on March 22, 2017 at a function held in Valapad. The declaration was made by Shri E.K. Thomas, President of the Valapad Panchayat, and it follows the successful ground level implementation of “Project E-Valapad” initiated by Manappuram Finance Ltd. in partnership with the Panchayat. Project E-Valapad aimed at spreading digital financial literacy in shops and household in the Valapad village area. For this purpose, a dedicated team consisting of employees of the company, ward members and a batch of trained volunteer students from the nearby S.N. College Nattika fanned out to all the wards. They went door-to-door imparting training to all the households in the use of various online means of payments and other financial transactions. Their mission was to ensure that at least one member of each household would become e-literate in terms of being conversant with the different platforms of making cashless transactions. Over a period of 5 days, the volunteers managed to cover 8,742 households out of a total of 9,809 households. With the successful conclusion of the project, Valapad can now lay claim to the status of a fully digitally literate village. The village has an area of 16.33 sq. km with a population of about 35,000, a literacy rate of 86.5%, and with the BPL population at 40% (2011 census). Manappuram Finance Ltd., a leading NBFC rooted in Valapad, is committed to spreading digital financial literacy among communities it is engaged with. Recently, the company’s officials had experienced first-hand some of the ground level difficulties faced by the local people in transitioning to cashless mode of transactions. Manappuram’s MD & CEO, Shri V.P. Nandakumar, conceived Project E-Valapad and directed a team within the company to approach Valapad Panchayat for implementation.

In fact, Manappuram began as a village brand, and that was how it stood for many decades. It was strongly identified with the village of Valapad where it was established in 1949, and where it functioned as a single branch business involved in money lending and pawn broking on a modest scale. This was how remained until 1986, when its founder Shri V.C. Padmanabhan (father of Shri V.P. Nandakumar) expired.Remarkably, even as it remained a business with strictly limited reach, it had managed to become a highly successful and greatly trusted brand with deep roots in the local community. Over the decades, Shri Padmanabhan had earned a reputation for integrity and the firm became known in the area as a safe-haven for the deposits of the local people, offering them higher returns along with assured safety. True to the stereotype of a conservative banker, Shri Padmanabhan was averse to risks. He ran his business on a capital base of Rs.5 lakhs and had imposed upon himself a voluntary limit of Rs.25 lakhs being the maximum deposits he would accept from the public. Beyond this limit, potential depositors were either turned away or made to wait for their turn in a queue. As and when an existing depositor withdrew his money, Shri Padmanabhan would send out inland letters to the next in line, informing them of the availability of a slot and grateful depositors would rush in with their money.And such was the formidable reputation of the firm that even as it remained anchored in Valapad, the deposits came in from around the world, from locals who had moved out of the Valapad area to the Gulf countries and to other parts of India in search of employment, and who continued to carry their trust in the Manappuram name with them.When Shri Nandakumar took over the reins in 1986, it was this resolute trust in the Manappuram name—the goodwill that served as a hidden capital of the business—that he was able to leverage. Very early on, he decided to do away with the voluntary limits on deposits and loans and business levels shot up, quickly going over the one crore rupee mark and beyond. However, before long, the limitations of operating under a proprietary concern became clear and Manappuram Finance Limited (MAFIL) was incorporated in 1992. The company went in early for an IPO in 1995 because the experience of trying to raise funds from the Commercial Banks was frustrating—even after mortgaging his personal residence, Banks were unwilling to lend him the amounts he was looking for. But the financial implications of a public issue were daunting. At that time, the rule was that a company going in for the IPO should have a minimum of Rs.3 crores as paid-up capital and MAFIL, at the time, was about half of that. Shri Nandakumar launched an initiative to collect small retail investments from among the Manappuram customers belonging to the Valapad area who were personally known to him. Once again, it was the trust that people of the area had in the Manappuram name that came to his rescue. The funds were mobilized and the issue went through without a hitch.This was how Manappuram Finance Limited (MAFIL) got its start and the rest, as they say, is history.The Social Relevance of Gold LoansV.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO.In recent months, there’s been a spate of media articles focussed on the success enjoyed by the leading players in the gold loan segment (incidentally, one of India’s fastest growing businesses), and how more and more people are shedding age-old taboos to borrow money against their gold jewellery. While this traditional business of lending money against gold was professionalized and scaled-up in recent years by Kerala-based NBFCs, all the major national banks have now jumped into the fray with enthusiasm. Moreover, the media attention is not restricted to India alone. Both the New York Times (“Out from India’s alleys, gold loans gain respect,” September 28, 2009) and the Washington Post (“In India, gold loans gain popularity as precious metal's prices soar,” January 12, 2010) recently carried stories about the growing popularity of gold loans in India.It is therefore an apt moment to acquaint the reader with an insider’s perspective on why gold loans matter and why they hold so much promise for our country’s future.Gold and domestic savingsIn India the savings habits of the poor and lower classes differ significantly from the richer sections. While the rich invest their savings across many different kinds of assets, the poor continue to invest their savings mainly in gold. In fact, in rural areas, this is often a necessity because of lack of access to banks. Also, there are strong cultural factors at work in India which make gold not only a desirable but also a necessary asset to hold. Gold is traditionally a store of value, protecting our savings from inflationary devaluation. It also serves important ceremonial purposes, such as in a wedding celebration where gold is always the preferred gift. With increasing prosperity and sophistication, the relative importance of gold to the well-off may have declined, but among the poor it continues to rule.The debt-trapPeople in a rural, agrarian society will necessarily face the problem of fluctuating or unsteady incomes. The bulk of their earnings come in the two harvest seasons and the rest of the year can be difficult. It is no surprise that they frequently resort to borrowing money. Quite often, this involves a trip to the local money lender. The money lender is willing to oblige but the interest rates are sky-high which makes repayment a big concern. Loans go into a cycle of defaults and rollovers at ever higher rates of interest and, occasionally, the money lender ends up with the title to the property of the borrowers.The many advantages of gold loansIf only people would fall back on their savings in the form of gold, and borrow money at reasonable rates of interest against the pledge of their gold ornaments, the debt-trap can be curbed to a large extent. Yet it does not happen because we are all emotionally attached to our gold jewellery and, even in these more permissive times, there is a stigma attached to pledging gold to borrow money. In fact, it is considered a sign of desperation so that when people borrow against gold, they don’t want their neighbours to know of it. And so, the reality is that rather than use their gold to raise money, their instinctive preference is to go to a moneylender and borrow at exorbitant rates. Avoids debt trap: A gold loan is settled either by repayment or, in case of default, by sale of the pledged security. The cycle of non-payment and rollovers of the loan at escalating rates of interest does not happen. In the worst case the borrower may lose his gold but there is no debt trap.Simple procedures, fast disbursal: The formalities in availing gold loans are minimal and procedures are simple. In practice, the entire process should hardly take fifteen to twenty minutes. This makes gold loans ideal for the micro-finance segment where the loan amounts are small and where there is no point in testing the borrower’s patience with elaborate procedure.No depreciation of underlying asset: Unlike other secured loans, the underlying asset in a gold loan is not subject to depreciation. At the same time, unlike land, it is a liquid asset and the transaction costs involved when enforcing the security are minimal. Thanks to this, the lender always enjoys a degree of comfort not available in other loans, and he does not have to go chasing after the borrower for timely repayments of instalments or EMIs. As for a borrower facing temporary difficulties, the only compulsion is to keep on servicing the interest component, till his situation permits repayment.In practice, without recourse: Gold loans are effectively given out on a “without recourse” basis. Although the fine print of the loan agreement incorporates the right of recourse to the other assets of the borrower, in practice, this is almost never enforced. Defaults are settled by sale of the pledged gold and losses (if any) are written off. There are no recovery agents to go chasing after the borrower and his other properties with threats of legal action, court orders etc. In contrast, in a typical “secured” loan from a bank, in addition to the primary security, you need to put up collateral and bring along a Guarantor who also gets hauled into court in case of default.No questions asked: People often borrow money on account of social compulsions which cannot be avoided in our cultural context; occasions like weddings, festivals, religious and social obligations etc. In this context, there is no denying that India’s banking sector continues to carry a hangover from the days of credit rationing that bank lending must always be for “productive” purposes. On the other hand, gold loans recognise that someone urgently in need of money cannot instead be made to settle for a lecture on wasteful consumption. Money is advanced solely on the criterion of the value of gold pledged and questions about the purpose of the loan would only be to confirm that anti-social or wildly speculative activities are not involved.Suited for the unorganised sector: Gold loans are ideal for those employed in the informal or unorganised sector and lacking documents to prove their incomes. This is a segment conventional banks generally avoid because their appraisal and credit scoring is based on formal documentation. Incidentally, more than 90 percent of India’s workforce is employed in the unorganised sector.Moral pressure against default: The recent success of the micro-finance sector has brought attention to the advantage of the group approach when lending to the poor. The loan is extended to individuals in a group and a default by any one member leads to the entire group being denied subsequent loans. Therefore, there is collective moral pressure on each member from the rest of the group to repay in time.Something like this is at work in a gold loan too. There is no group approach but the market practice that gold loans are generally extended against household used jewellery has a similar impact. The fact is, borrowers and their families are emotionally attached to their family jewellery. Very often, it would have been acquired during important occasions like a marriage or the birth of a child etc. Occasions of wilful default, particularly with intention to capitalise on fluctuations in gold prices, are few and far between.It therefore stands to reason that banks and financial institutions that choose to scale-up their gold loan portfolios would be able to do so with minimum risks. And, from a regulator’s perspective, gold loans can actually serve to minimise systemic risks.Gains for the wider economy: India has the world’s largest stock of privately held gold with informed estimates ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of gold. When this gold is kept idle in our lockers and vaults, it is a drag on the Indian economy: it has the effect of keeping billions of dollars in savings (at a conservative price of $1,000 /oz., it amounts to about $480 to $ 650 billion) out of the financial system. This is a huge sum that otherwise could have been lent out to industries and for building infrastructure. When people borrow against gold (technically called “monetization”), the impact is to set in motion a whole new chain of economic activity boosting demand and consumption expenditure in the economy.This is the classic debt-trap and a root cause of so much distress among the rural poor.The many advantages of gold loansIf only people would fall back on their savings in the form of gold, and borrow money at reasonable rates of interest against the pledge of their gold ornaments, the debt-trap can be curbed to a large extent.

When people borrow against gold (technically called “monetization”), the impact is to set in motion a whole new chain of economic activity boosting demand and consumption expenditure in the economy.The road aheadThere is now increasing recognition that economic and social policies need to be rooted in reality, not in any visions of an ideal world. Today, the ground realities are that significant sections of the rural poor continue to lack access to banks, either to park their savings in, or as a fallback for loans in times of need. Also, given the country’s atypical cultural context, gold continues to play an important part in our lives, reflected in the fact that India is consistently the world’s largest consumer of gold. Under these circumstances, the organised gold loan segment is potentially a vehicle for social transformation. Considering that 65 percent of our massive private stock of gold is held by rural households, and that 75 percent of the gold loan market continues to be with the unorganised sector (local moneylenders and pawnbrokers), this is a market with tremendous potential for growth.At the same time, there is an urgent need for the government and the regulators to recognise the professionalism and transparency that the organised sector brings to this field and encourage its growth. We need a radical shift in the regulatory approach, from one of tolerance with a multiplicity of hurdles, to that of facilitation and active promotion. A useful beginning can be made by not treating this sector on a par with local moneylenders and pawnbrokers. And, it will help if gold loans are not clubbed with other NBFC lending when prescribing regulatory capital.The distress faced by India’s farmers in recent years highlights the need to move on multiple fronts in extending timely credit to the rural masses. Gold loans must be made a part of this process.Note: An edited version of this article was published in the op-ed page of The Economic Times dated July 29, 2010 under the title “Gold Loans aid financial inclusion”.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/policy/Gold-loans-aid-financial-inclusion/articleshow/6230807.cms Overview of the Company Management Team A Profile of the MD & CEO Promoter Group Entities Brand Manappuram, the early days The Social Relevance of Gold Loans Overview of the Company Management Team A Profile of the MD & CEO Promoter Group Entities Brand Manappuram, the early days The Social Relevance of Gold Loans Besides focus on the business, the cause of the wider community is central to the vision of the company. The Manappuram Foundation was established in October 2009 to drive the company’s initiatives in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The major project of the Foundation is an original scheme, “Janaraksha Manappuram Free Health Insurance Scheme” extending health insurance to 20,000 Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in the seven Panchayats located around the Valapad Head Office of the Company. They are now eligible for free medical care up to Rs.60,000 per year along with cashless treatment at some of the leading hospitals in Thrissur District.The Manappuram Foundation has set up the Manappuram Academy for Professional Education to impart free coaching for Professional Courses like CA/CS/ICWA, to bright students from low income households. The company was honoured with a 'Special Commendation' at the Golden Peacock Awards for Corporate Social Responsibility for the year 2014.As a company focused on gold loans, Manappuram was prone to the concentration risk. Financial sector regulators in India have been expressing concern over the concentration risk inherent in the mono-line business model. To assuage their concerns, the company initiated bold moves to become a multi product company. Over the last six years, the company has diversified into new business areas like microfinance, vehicle and housing finance, and SME lending. In February 2015, the company acquired Asirvad Microfinance Pvt. Ltd. with AUM a little short of Rs. 3,000 million. Today, six years of its takeover, AUM has around Rs. 60,000 million. Accelerated growth is reported in the other new business segments too. Our other new businesses — Commercial vehicle loans and housing finance loans —now contribute over Rs. 17,000 million to our total AUM of about Rs. 272.24 billion. Overall, non-gold businesses contributed 30 percent of the total business as of March 31, 2021. RS.

The first non banking financial company (NBFC) in Kerala to receive a Certificate of Registration issued by the RBI, it was also among the earliest to go for an IPO in 1995. In 2007, it became the first Kerala based NBFC to receive investment from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) when the celebrated PE fund, Sequoia Capital, invested Rs.700 million along with Hudson Equity Holdings. Sizable foreign investment was received during two QIPS in 2010 when a total of Rs.12,450 million was raised. Manappuram Finance Ltd. was the first NBFC in Kerala to obtain the highest short term credit rating of A1+ from ICRA. In 2010, it became the first Kerala-based NBFC to offer ESOPs (Employee Stock Option Plan) to its middle and senior management functionaries.As a pioneer and trailblazer, Manappuram Finance Ltd. has always been an innovator par excellence that enabled it to lead the way and stay ahead in the game.Technology innovations: In the matter of technology, Manappuram was one of the earliest to adopt the “core banking” platform. This was no mean achievement considering that unlike the banking sector there were no ready-made software solutions for gold loans. It came about only because the company invested in developing its own proprietary solutions, and today its technology platform is one of its core strengths. The investment in technology has paid off in many ways, for instance, in streamlining procedures to reduce turnaround times in gold loan disbursal and in implementing advanced risk management practices as described below.Critical to the success of a large scale gold loan business is the ability to weed out spurious and substandard gold at the pledge stage itself. The purity testing that is carried out essentially verifies the purity of the ornament at a particular point or two. It is not designed for 100 percent certainty. Moreover, the gold loans business emphasize speed and hassle free experience. Therefore, simplicity of procedure is also a must and a balance has to be struck. At Manappuram, advanced risk management practices were put in place that drew upon the promoter’s intimate understanding of the business. It was implemented through the IT platform which generates alerts to management upon any suspicious or abnormal transactions at the branches. For example, the gold loan business focuses on household used jewellery to which borrowers may be expected to have an emotional connect. When a branch accepts multiple numbers of the same ornament for pledge, it is more likely to be a local jeweller or pawnbroker and the system automatically flags the transaction for verification by internal auditors.In keeping with its record of technology led innovations, the company launched its latest product “Online Gold Loans” in 2015. A customer who has completed the initial formalities can now avail a gold loan 24X7, from anywhere in the world, in fact, even as he sits at home. The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to his bank account. The concept is now proposed to be extended further with launch of a co-branded debit card that would allow even customers without access to bank accounts to withdraw the money from an ATM anywhere.Product innovations: Manappuram has led the way in the matter of product innovations too. Gold loans were for long sold as a “one-size-fits-all” product. The company was a pioneer in introducing variety to it, for instance, by offering progressively higher loan amounts at higher price points. It was also the first to come up with “one-day interest” where borrowers have the option to settle a gold loan at their earliest convenience, even within a day, at a time when the norm was to recover a minimum interest of seven days, or even a month.The most recent innovation is the launch of short tenured gold loans. Historically, all gold loans were sanctioned for one year and bullet repayments of both interest and principal was the norm. After the fierce correction in gold prices in 2013, gold loan companies were faced with higher defaults and profitability took a hit. Manappuram Finance Ltd. launched short term gold loans of three and six month tenure and today, the bulk of its gold loan portfolio has been shifted to the short term buckets. This has minimised price risk which is otherwise a major concern in gold loans.Innovative approach to raising finance: For a non banking financial company (NBFC), raising funds was a big challenge in the nineties. In the aftermath of the CRB scam of 1997, raising deposits from the public was difficult and banks were not comfortable with lending to NBFCs in general. Moreover, Manappuram’s foray into gold loans was untested as a business model. Growth was slow in the initial days. The picture was to change only after the company hit upon unconventional ways to raise funds.In the first breakthrough, Manappuram became the first gold loan company to raise finance through the securitization and assignment route in a tie up with ICICI Bank. The arrangement with ICICI Bank continued to work well for a few years and the company was put on the growth path. Buoyed by the success, the company planned a big expansion of the branch network. However, around 2006, ICICI Bank faced some regulatory hurdles regarding securitization and they could no longer fund the company. With ICICI Bank pulling out, the expansion plans were in jeopardy.At this point, the company chanced to get its second break. Temasek, the sovereign investment fund of Singapore, was looking to expand its footprint in the Indian financial market. Mr. Nandakumar happened to be in Singapore to take part in a conference of NBFCs. Having heard Mr. Nandakumar speak about the gold loan business, Temasek expressed interested in financing Manappuram through their India arm Fullerton. Temasek’s debt participation provided the visibility, and paved the way for other international players to follow.In December 2007, Manappuram became the first NBFC in Kerala to attract foreign institutional investment when the celebrated PE fund Sequoia Capital invested Rs.700 million together with Hudson Equity Holdings. Since then, the company has regularly received foreign investment. The second round of private equity funding in November 2008 was led by Ashmore Alchemy which, together with Sequoia and Hudson, put in another Rs.1,080 million. Sizable foreign investment was received during the two QIPS in 2010 when a total of Rs.12,450 million was raised. Once private equity came in, the company was able to shift gears and grow much faster than before because now even the PSU banks were willing to lend to it. From this point onwards, there was no looking back.Conventionally, companies have sought funds from foreign investors after they have tapped the domestic banks and other financial institutions. In the case of Manappuram, the order was upended. Because the domestic banks were uncomfortable lending to NBFCs, especially one with an untested business model focused on gold loans, the company went out of India and roped in the foreign players first. Once they were persuaded, the domestic players became more confident about lending to the company.Innovative Marketing Campaign with multiple celebrity Brand Ambassadors: Despite the vast amount of gold in private hands in India, the gold loan business is yet to grow to its true potential even today. There was a continuing stigma attached to pledging gold. Rather than use their gold to raise money, many preferred to go to moneylenders and borrow at exorbitant rates.Manappuram has been proactive in tackling this sensitive issue head-on. It followed a strategy of a big-budget advertising campaign that revolved around celebrity brand ambassadors with strong regional appeal, who talked about gold loans to the masses in their own language. When the fashion was to use one celebrity brand ambassador for a nationwide campaign, Manappuram’s campaign beginning in 2010 had a galaxy of super stars like Akshay Kumar, Mohanlal, Mithun Chakravarty, Vikram, Venkatesh etc. and they were used to target different geographies; Mohanlal for Kerala, Akshay Kumar for the Hindi speaking belt, Vikram for Tamil Nadu etc. The campaign was successful in growing the gold loan category as a whole and benefits were reaped by players across the sector.Manppuram Finance Ltd. is a professionally run company promoted by Shri V.P. Nandakumar who controls approximately 35% of the total equity of the company. A similar share is held by various Indian and foreign private equity funds while the balance is dispersed among the public. The shares of the company are traded on both the BSE and NSE.

Incorporated in 1992 and promoted by Shri. V.P. Nandakumar, the company was listed on the BSE in 1995. Over the two decades since, it has grown rapidly and expanded across India. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had 4148 branches across 23 states and 4 UTs with Assets under management (AUM) of Rs 13,723 crore. The company’s net worth stood at Rs. 3,575 crores. Manappuram Finance Ltd. and its MD & CEO, Mr. V.P. Nandakumar, is widely hailed in stock market circles as one of the leading wealth creators for investors. In January 2017, MoneyLife magazine ranked the company at 13th in a list of the top 20 wealth creators in the stock market over the preceding decade.RECENT DIVERSIFICATIONS: In recent years, the company has diversified into promising new areas like microfinance, affordable home loans, commercial vehicle finance, SME lending, insurance broking etc. The entry into microfinance follows the acquisition in 2015 of the Chennai based Asirvad Microfinance Pvt.

Safalya | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Safalya SafalyaReal life stories about ordinary people empowered to seize the opportunities that came their way, thanks to Manappuram Gold Loans.A tractor driver becomes tractor ownerPaka Dillip Dora, used to be a tractor driver living in a village called Erendra in the Ganjam District of Orissa. His father is a marginal farmer owning a small plot of one and a half acres in a drought-prone area. Dillip worked on daily wages as a tractor driver with a landlord in a neighbouring village. His brother, who works as a mechanic in Dubai, occasionally sends money home and the family was considering buying more agricultural land with the savings when a civil construction project came up in the area. Consequently, there was good demand for tractors to remove soil. Dillip decided to shelve the idea of going for more land and instead thought of buying a second hand tractor.​A deal was struck with a prospective seller and an advance amount of Rs.20,000/- was paid to seal the agreement to buy the tractor for Rs.2.80 lakhs. The agreement stipulated that the balance amount would be paid on or before January 10, 2011 failing which the advance amount would be forfeited.As the due date approached, it turned out that the balance amount could not be raised in full and he was about to forfeit the advance amount. It was at such a moment of despair when he was all but resigned to washing his hands off the advance amount of Rs.20,000 that he decided to reengage himself as a tractor driver with the landlord.Coincidentally, that very same day, he chanced to see a television advertisement for Manappuram Gold Loan at his employer’s residence. He promptly went home, enquired about the available gold, gathered whatever was there and came to Manappuram’s Old Bus Stand Branch at Berhampur. It was a pleasant surprise when the branch officials told him he was eligible for a loan of Rs.56,000/-. This was well above his expectations and more than adequate for the purpose. The balance amount was paid on the last day of the deadline and today, as a proud tractor-owner, he earns about a thousand rupees a day from soil removing work in the construction sector.Gold Loan Branch: Berhampur Old Bus stand Branch, OrissaDate of first transaction: January 10, 2011Purpose of Loan: Meet shortfall for purchase of second hand tractor A young widow supports her familyV Rajani is a young widow from Palakkad who runs a small business supplying cooked food items like “vada”, “appam”, “bajji” etc. to the pushcart vendors around the city bus stand. It was the death of her husband two years ago and the compulsion to earn a livelihood and support her family that forced her to start off on her own.When she began, she had no background in business and she had no idea if she would get a bank loan. Like most Indian women, she had some gold and with that she came to Manappuram’s Palakkad Town RS Road branch for a gold loan. And now she earns anywhere up to twelve hundred rupees a day from her business. What is more, over the course of two years, she managed to save enough money to buy a small plot of land. Today, but for the gold loans that she takes from Manappuram, she has no other liabilities. She now looks forward to building a house for her family consisting of her mother and child.Gold Loan Branch: Palakad Town RS Road Branch, KeralaDate of first transaction: May 13, 2009Purpose of Loan: Working capital in business of supplying cooked food itemsA small Transport Operator survives in a competitive businessSukumaran P is a lorry driver, who drives his own lorry.

However, it was Manappuram Finance that he finally chose because this company gave the maximum loan per gram. His first loan was for Rs.17,700/- which was used in the business. From this time onwards, he has been a regular gold loan barrower of Manappuram’s Irrity Branch, in connection with his business.Looking back, Mr. Sukumaran is convinced his first decision to approach Manapppuram for gold loan was the right decision. Initially influenced by the high LTV, he now finds other aspects about Manappuram’s functioning of convenience to him. For instance, the extended working hours of the branch, from 8.30 in the morning to 5.30 in the evening, is convenient to him. Also, the fact that branch functions on Sundays as well. Besides, even during rush hour, transactions are completed on time.

Their debts mounted and they began facing harassment.It was at this moment of despair that that she began thinking about starting a new business.

For this purpose, they first took a loan from a credit society run by a woman’s Self Help Group (SHG). But the amount was not adequate for the purpose. So, Vaheeda and her husband decided to pledge their gold. They went to many establishments but the amount they offered was not enough. Finally, Vaheeda and her husband come to know that Manappuram Finance gives higher amounts as loans against gold. They came to Manappuram Finance and were pleasantly surprised by how easy and hassle free the process was. With the gold loan, they were able to start the business.

Help Gold Loan | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Help We Are Ready to Help YouOnline Gold Loan FAQGold Loan FAQOnline Payments FAQPaytm FAQExpress Pay FAQGold Loan FaqsHow are Gold Loans different from other loans like Personal Loan or Credit Card?Gold loan is sanctioned by accepting the gold ornaments of the customer as pledge. Personal loan is sanctioned on the basis of source of income and repayment capacity of an applicant. It is true that Gold loans, like personal loans or credit card borrowings, are often used for short term household requirements. However, in terms of the cost and ease of availing the loan, and the convenience when repaying, gold loans are a better bargain. Personal loans and credit card borrowings are unsecured loans and therefore may carry a higher rate of interest. Moreover, personal loans require considerable effort in documentation formalities and they commit you to an inflexible EMI schedule for repayment. Gold loans, on the other hand, are cheaper and can be availed of in minutes. You can also stretch the repayment to your convenience; the only requirement is that you have to service the interest periodically. Credit card borrowings may be easier to avail than even gold loans but the interest rates are prohibitive and it can lure people into a debt-trap.Who is eligible to avail Manappuram Gold loans? What security has to be provided?Anyone who is above 18 years and who owns gold ornaments can avail the loan. (Note: minors are not eligible.) To obtain the loan you need to submit your gold jewellery (within a karat range of 18 to 24 k) at the branch. The loan amount that is sanctioned will be based on the gold valuation which involves verification of its purity. The weight of stones etc. fixed on the ornaments will be deducted for the purpose of valuation.What are the documents required for taking loan against gold ornaments?

All loan approvals are at the sole discretion of the branch head.Are the pledged gold ornaments safe and secure with Manappuram?Gold ornaments accepted as pledge by the customers are stored at the branches in strong safe / strong room built to the standards and specifications applicable to commercial banks.

Interest is calculated on daily product basis on the amount of loan outstanding at the end of the day.How can customers settle the loan account and get back the gold ornaments?The customer has to submit the pawn ticket (given to them at the time of taking loan) to the counter staff at the branch with a request to close the loan account.

Due care is taken during appraisal to ensure that there is no damage to the ornament during any stage of appraising or storing.What are the things that people should keep in mind while taking a gold loan?The most important things from the customer’s perspective are transparency, security and choice of loan product to suit individual requirements. Transparency would help the customer see for himself what he gets in return for what he pays. There should be no hidden costs and no nasty surprises. Security is about how well the gold is physically secured, and also about the internal systems and procedures at the company which ensure that there is no scope for any mala fide actions after the jewellery has been pledged. The choice of loan products should cover the range from high LTV (loan to value) to low LTV, with appropriate variations in interest rates. At Manappuram, you will find that all these aspects are well taken care of.What makes Manappuram Finance different from other providers of gold loans?In addition to the transparency, security and range of its gold loan products (as mentioned above), Manappuram Finance distinguishes itself from others primarily on the basis of the ease with which gold loans can be availed from our branches.

Our streamlined systems and procedures ensure that a gold loan can be availed in a matter of minutes. Also, we offer the highest LTV to those interested in availing the maximum amount of loan against their jewellery. We are able to do this because with our long experience in the business, we have acquired the capability to handle the extra risk involved.What are some of the gold loan schemes that Manappuram Finance offers to suit its customers from different income groups?Our gold loan schemes fall broadly into following categories:a) High loan to value: These schemes offer the maximum amount of loan per gram. At the same time, in keeping with the extra risk, the interest cost to the borrower is higher.b) Low interest rate: In this category, the interest rates are lower but the Loan to Value (LTV) is also comparatively less.Our products are tailored not to the income group of the customer, but to relevant considerations like how much loan customers would like to avail against a given item of jewellery, and their comfort levels with respect to the interest rate and periodicity of repayment of interest and principal. Incidentally, gold loans can be availed at our branches for amounts as low as a thousand rupees and as high as 1.5 crore & even above 1.5 crore as exception.In case of default, when will the gold jewellery be auctioned off?In case of persisting overdue, the ornaments are liable to be auctioned but only after giving sufficient notice to the borrower. Manappuram serves a reminder to its overdue accounts apart from periodic SMS reminders to our customers to alert them to the overdue in the account. Moreover, we also send auction intimation prior to the auction. We reiterate that(1) periodical monthly payment of interest due and(2) reset your account on or before due date, are recommended as an easy way to avoid such contingencies.Whom do I contact for more details?Kindly get in touch with the staff at the branch nearest to where you are located.

We will target growth of 10-15% in gold loans in coming fiscal year: VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! We will target growth of 10-15% in gold loans in coming fiscal year: VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance March 29, 2022Financial ExpressManappuram Share However, the microfinance book posted a modest decline in volumes as we decided to go slow on fresh disbursements and focus more on collections in the context of the Omicron surge.However, the microfinance book posted a modest decline in volumes as we decided to go slow on fresh disbursements and focus more on collections in the context of the Omicron surge.How do you review the third quarter?The important takeaway from our Q3 performance is that despite the Omicron impact, we have achieved good growth in our business volumes from our core business of gold loans, as also from vehicle loans and home loans. Our consolidated AUM of Rs 30,400 crore grew 7% sequentially and 10% year on year. Gold loans showed growth of 8.3% sequentially after suffering a decline in Q1. Likewise, there was good growth in vehicle and equipment finance and in home loans. However, the microfinance book posted a modest decline in volumes as we decided to go slow on fresh disbursements and focus more on collections in the context of the Omicron surge.You have mentioned yield declining due to competition. What is the outlook?In Q2, we had launched a few lower-yielding gold loan schemes targeting high-value customers, following the decline in volumes in Q1. It impacted the yield on gold loans, which fell from 25.3% in Q2 to 20.3% in Q3. These schemes were initially applicable to the larger ticket loans of Rs 1 lakh and over, and subsequently the eligibility was recalibrated based on market conditions. From what I can see, thanks to the abundance of liquidity in the market, the competition appears to be targeting business with a yield of around 17% in mind. But we are trying to maintain our yield at a somewhat higher level. In the process, our growth may get moderated for some time, say, one or two quarters more. However, I believe that these other NBFC players may not be able to sustain business at that low yield and therefore they will have to increase their yield soon. That’s why I expect that the present phase of intense price competition among NBFCs will be a temporary phenomenon and in the coming quarters the situation will improve.What about AUM and what is the guidance for the next fiscal?Our consolidated AUM has grown by about 7% sequentially in Q3 and the growth was led mainly by gold loans. I expect improvement in the coming quarters given the declining trend of Covid-19 and expected recovery in economic activities, including the unorganised sector. Assuming that we don’t see further disruptions from the pandemic and newer variants, we would target growth of about 10 to 15% in gold loans in the coming fiscal year.What about competition in large loans — ticket size of Rs 1 lakh and above?Following the disruptions in the financial services sector caused by the pandemic, private and PSU banks as well as other non-gold loan-focused NBFCs had sought to counter the stress in their general loan books by pushing their gold loan offerings and competing on price. They had particularly targeted our high-value customers having loans above Rs 1 lakh for takeover. Since then, we have responded with aggressive efforts of our own to retain and attract high-value customers. The results are visible in growth in our gold loans portfolio, which crossed Rs 20,000 crore and is up 8.3% sequentially. Importantly, this was accompanied by proportionate growth in gold collateral which, at 70 tonne, is up 7.8% sequentially.Do you feel that cost of funds has bottomed out and will rise in the coming quarters?The cost of funds appears to have bottomed out as far as the lending rates of the banks are concerned, and the likely trend from now on will be upward. In our case, even if the incremental borrowing costs were to go up marginally, to the extent it replaces higher cost borrowings of the past, our average borrowing cost may continue to remain stable for a while. Besides, increasing interest rates may not be a problem because the pace of such increase will be calibrated, and we don’t anticipate any sudden shock. Also, if the cost of funds go up, it is likely to cut short the price competition among NBFCs and that will be positive for the sector.Read more Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

In a press release, the Chennai-based MFI said that the transaction comes at a time when the microfinance sector in India has faced higher stress from lockdowns imposed after the onset of the second wave of the pandemic. “This deal, following closely on the heels of an ECB transaction with the US based WorldBusiness Capital, reaffirms the confidence that leading lending institutions have in India’s microfinance sector and its prospects for growth,” Raja Vaidyanathan, MD, Asirvad Microfinance was quoted in the release.

What’s next for gold loans after the pandemic? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! What’s next for gold loans after the pandemic? October 10, 2021Economic TimesWebmaster Share The Hindu Business Line October 10, 2021 Gold loans have not lost the sheen Over the last decade, the rise of NBFCs that focus on gold loans has been well-chronicled by the media. They are now widely acknowledged as being instrumental in formalising an activity hitherto the preserve of shadowy moneylenders and pawnbrokers operating away from regulatory oversight. Banks were largely uninterested in gold loans, giving a free run to the unorganised players until their dominance was challenged by gold loan NBFCs. But these days, we see the private and public sector banks make a vigorous play for gold loans.According to the RBI’s latest monthly data on sectoral deployment of bank credit, the gold loans portfolio of banks stood at ₹62,926 crore as of August 27, 2021. Compared to ₹37,860 crore a year ago, that is a jump of 66 per cent in one year. Go further back and, in August 2019, it stood at just ₹26,542 crore. Clearly, banks in India are now a rising force in the gold loan space.Favourable treatment What explains the spectacular growth in the gold loans portfolio of the banking sector over the last one year? There’s no doubt that favourable treatment by the regulators was an important factor. Early in August 2020, the RBI had announced an increase in the loan-to-value ratio on gold loans given by banks (from 75 per cent to 90 per cent) up to March 31, 2021, to provide relief to borrowers affected by the pandemic. That relaxation was not extended to NBFCs, and it opened up a limited-time window of competitive advantage for banks that was duly exploited by them. Another reason was that sporadic lockdowns had a milder impact on the organised sector, whose digital reach and capabilities are much greater. Corporate India, for instance, reported higher-than-expected profits in the lockdown-affected quarters even without gain in volumes, thanks largely to the cost cutting enabled by their digital reach.

Manappuram Finance Q1 net rises 26% to Rs 417 crore, recommends interim dividend of Rs 0.75/share | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance Q1 net rises 26% to Rs 417 crore, recommends interim dividend of Rs 0.75/share September 27, 2022Money ControlManappuram Share The cost of borrowing declined by 16 bps on a sequential basis during the April-June quarter, it said.Manappuram Finance on Tuesday reported a nearly 26 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 417 crore for the first quarter of the current fiscal year 2021-22 on healthy growth in interest income aided by a fall in borrowing cost.The company had posted a net profit of Rs 332 crore in the same quarter ended June 2020.Income from operations was up by 3.4 per cent to Rs 1,565 crore in Q1FY22 as against Rs 1,513 crore in Q1FY21, Manappuram Finance said in a regulatory filing.Net interest income grew by 13.3 per cent to Rs 1,072 crore as against Rs 946 crore in year ago quarter.The cost of borrowing declined by 16 bps on a sequential basis during the April-June quarter, it said.The company's consolidated assets under management (AUM) fell by 2.3 per cent to Rs 24,800 crore as of June 30, 2021, from Rs 25,300 crore in the year ago period.India's number two gold financing company said its gold AUM during the quarter was down by 6.8 per cent to Rs 16,500 crore from Rs 17,700 crore; while the gold tonnage dipped by 16 per cent to 58.1 tonne from 69 tonne.Gold AUM was impacted due to Covid-19, as many branches were either not functional or only partially functional leading to decline in new customer acquisitions. Borrowers also withdrew collateral due to Covid-19 stress, the company said.Manappuram Finance said it exercised prudence in risk management by auctioning the high LTV (loan to value) portfolio over the last two quarters."Proportion of high LTV portfolio of (over 80 per cent) had come down to 6 per cent. It has reduced due to better risk management."As prices of gold declined by 17 per cent from peak, it lead to some borrowers withdrawing collateral, it added.Non-gold AUM, however, grew by 8 per cent to Rs 8,200 crore from Rs 7,600 crore.Read more Previous NewsBanks are a force in gold loans thanks to NBFCsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Why is gold losing lustre? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Why is gold losing lustre? October 27, 2022The Hindu BusinesslineV P Nandkumar Share Prices hit by rising US interest rates, stronger dollarUnlike treasury bonds, gold is not an interest-bearing asset, and its attraction falls when safe alternatives like US treasury bonds begin to yield moreWhile the prices of commodities — from food to fertiliser to palm oil to crude oil — are soaring, yellow metal prices are weakening.Despite the spectre of sharply decelerating GDP growth, inflation the world over is surging, leaving most central banks with no choice but to embrace harsh monetary tightening. The IMF has forecast global inflation to remain elevated at 8.8 per cent through 2022 amid higher cost of energy and food articles.Theoretically, and this is also borne out by experience, gold is supposed to act as a hedge against high inflation typically brought about by unchecked money creation. Going by this hypothesis, gold should be seeing increased buying during the current bout of high inflation.What, then, explains the current incongruity of the price of a reliable safe-haven asset like gold falling at a time when inflation in the US persists at four-decade highs and with the rest of the world in a similar predicament? In fact, international prices of gold have declined almost 10 per cent till date this year.Softening pricesThis curious case of softening gold prices against the backdrop of global turmoil does have an explanation. It can be attributed to the synchronised weakening of the non-dollar currencies and the rising US interest rates. To put things in perspective, the benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield has touched 4 per cent, a multi-decade high. A year ago, it ruled at 1.5 per cent.For the sake of perspective, the price of gold is not dictated by the demand and supply of physical gold alone. There is an investment demand for gold as well as a speculative demand which, put together, means that the traded volume of gold far exceeds the physical quantity that actually changes hands.That’s why its market price also rests on other safe-haven bets such as the yield (or returns) on US treasury bills or the exchange value of the US dollar. Unlike treasury bonds, gold is not an interest-bearing asset, and its attraction falls when safe alternatives like US treasury bonds begin to yield more. The current yields on the US treasury long-dated notes have hardened to levels not seen after the 2008 crisis. Also, the persistence of higher inflation for a longer period has forced major central banks outside Japan to pivot to more hawkish stance than ever. A direct consequence of the US Federal Reserve’s back-to-back interest rate hikes has been the value of greenback climbing to muti-decade heights. The dollar index that tracks the value of the US currency against a basket of major legal tenders including Japanese Yen and British Pound Sterling has been trending above the 113 mark for months now. A year ago, the dollar index was trading at about 93.7, a substantial gain of 20.6 per cent.These two factors are the major reasons that cap the upside rally in the international gold prices. It should also be noted that gold is priced in dollars in the international market and, therefore, a strong dollar limits its headroom for moving up.All this is not to suggest that gold has reached the end of the road as a safe-haven asset. Nor does it mean that gold’s function as a highly liquid store of value and a fall-back medium of exchange has eroded for good. On the contrary, its intrinsic value remains intact and, as an asset class over the long term, it has fared well compared to other asset classes like bonds, bank deposits or even real estate.Over the five decades since the end of the gold standard in 1971, the price of gold has appreciated to $1,800 per ounce — a CAGR of 8.2 per cent. That is a decent rate of return for a 50-year period.What remains to be seen is how the yellow metal will fare once the current interest rate hiking cycle in the US eases, either as inflation comes down (a soft landing) or as the economy proves simply unable to bear the cost of money going any higher (a hard landing where the economy tips into recession or stagflation). Should it be a hard landing, count on gold to shine once again.Read more Previous NewsThe Not-So-United KingdomNext News"In Manappuram, learning is a way of life” - VP NandakumarPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

"In Manappuram, learning is a way of life” - VP Nandakumar | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! "In Manappuram, learning is a way of life” - VP Nandakumar October 20, 2022Brand Stories Share Manappuram Finance Ltd is a leading non-banking financial institution that comes first in the minds of Malayalis when thinking about gold loans. After all, who can forget Manappuram’s iconic advertisement, “Veetil swarnam vechittenthinu naattil kenu nadappoo” featuring Malayalam superstar Mohanlal.Founded in 1949 at Valapad in Thrissur district by VC Padmanabhan, Manappuram has gained the trust of thousands of customers. Under Padmanabhan’s son, VP Nandakumar, Manappuram Finance Ltd has become a prestigious institution with more than 5,300 branches across the country having around 44,000 employees. Today, Manappuram has assets worth Rs 31,000 crore.Apart from gold loans, Manappuram offers services like SME finance, Forex and Money transfer, vehicle loans, personal loans, micro home finance, etc. Manappuram Home Finance Ltd, Manappuram Insurance Brokers Ltd, Asirvad Microfinance Ltd, and Manappuram Comptech and Consultants Ltd are the subsidiaries.Earlier this month, Brand Stories met Mr. VP Nandakumar, the MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd. Here are the edited excerpts from the conversation:There have been many a winning strategy over the years but I would like to highlight one that worked even beyond our expectations. This initiative came during the 2009-2010 period. This was the time when we had received private equity and enough debt from various banks. We wanted to open more branches across the country.When we open a branch, there is a gestation period before we can break even or achieve profit in our business. But if we can bring down this gestation period, we can make gains. When we open a branch in a place where we are not known, it takes a longer gestation period. In those days, we were not known at the national level and I was thinking of how to tackle this problem.I knew that to do well in any geographical region, our brand needs to be recognised as a local player there and not just as a Kerala company or a national company. So, we decided to recruit brand ambassadors to represent the company in each region. For instance, just the same way as Mohanlal has a certain brand value in Kerala, Puneet Rajkumar has a good following in Karnataka and Vikram in Tamil Nadu. In the Hindi belt, of course, we decided to sign up Akshay Kumar. In all, we identified eight stars to represent Manappuram in various regions across the country.The profit for the previous year was Rs 120 crore while the profit budgeted for the following year was Rs 230 crore, without factoring in the actual cost of Rs 130 crore that would be incurred for the planned branding and advertising campaign. When the ad budget was presented, the board was apprehensive how a profit of Rs 230 crore could be achieved if we spend Rs 130 crore for the ad campaign alone. They reluctantly accepted the proposal on the assurance that they would be convinced through a monthly performance appraisal. To their surprise, we could report a profit of over Rs 300 crore during the year. And, Manappuram Finance became a household name cutting across regions.Priyadarshan, the renowned filmmaker, was drafted in to direct the TV commercial. During our discussion, I told him how even those who possessed gold used to borrow money at cut-throat rates from the unorganised market instead of going to an organised lender who would have charged a reasonable rate. The famous jingle, “Veetil swarnam vechittenthinu naattil kenu nadappoo,” was coined as a result of this discussion.1. Can you mention some of the key brand-building strategies behind Manappuram’s growth and success?There have been many a winning strategy over the years but I would like to highlight one that worked even beyond our expectations.

The famous jingle, “Veetil swarnam vechittenthinu naattil kenu nadappoo,” was coined as a result of this discussion.2. What is being done to motivate employees to ensure higher productivity?In Manappuram, learning is a way of life. Those who came in as matriculates have gone on to take MBA degrees at the company’s cost – we provide them both time and money. We have our own online training platform, that was developed in-house, called MADU. Hundreds of employees get MBAs, LLBs, BTechs and so on. We have tied up with premier institutes like BITS Pilani and Bharathiyar University to facilitate employees to continue their education. We also send our employees for training to various IIMs and reputed foreign universities for enhancing their knowledge and confidence. We reward their academic achievements by giving them promotions and increased responsibilities. By giving them such exposure, we empower them to face the world.3. You dedicated your life to Manappuram. What were the policies that you followed to scale up the company? It is simple. I always try to closely observe the market and enter the market at the right time. I take risks but at the same time, I manage the risk by learning continuously about the market.4. Can you explain the critical turning points in Manappuram’s growth?The first was listing the company way back in 1995 in the premier stock exchanges. We went for it at a time when knowledge about the capital market was not high, especially in Kerala. There were many other firsts. We were the first company in our sector to register with the Reserve Bank of India. We were the first to be allowed to get NRI deposits. We were also the first company to raise FDI in any industry in Kerala. We also got credit rating from leading credit rating agencies. These pioneering efforts gave us an advantage along with the branding exercise that I had referred to earlier.5. What were the main challenges faced by you and how did you overcome those?In the field of NBFCs, the regulatory framework took time to evolve and mature. Many of the large NBFCs had to exit the market. Doubts were cast about every company. As a result, there were many challenges, particularly on the liability side. But we overcame these by virtue of our sheer transparency, commitment and several pioneering initiatives.6. What is the number of current employees and the AUM of the company?We have around 44,000 employees all over the country and 5300 branches across India. Our Assets Under management (AUM) stands at Rs 31,000 crore as of now.7. How important is customer satisfaction and service? What are the policies adopted for it?Customer is really the king and without the customer’s satisfaction, no company can either exist or thrive. One important aspect of any business is service delivery and for this, Turn Around Time should be low and cost affordable. We adopted cutting-edge technology to deploy services such as online gold loan and doorstep gold loan. Once the customer has pledged the gold in a branch, he/she can transact from anywhere in the world. If a customer is unable to come to the branch, we go to his house and deliver. We have designed several products according to the customers’ needs. Through our microfinance subsidiary, we have been empowering women. In all our businesses including housing finance, vehicle finance, etc, customer is at the centre of it all.

Innovation In Business: The All-Important Ingredient | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Innovation In Business: The All-Important Ingredient September 23, 2022Unique Times Share In today’s fast-changing business environment, innovation is not just important but also essential for the survival and progress of any organisation. There are any number of examples of global giants that ruled the roost for years or decades but perished because they did not or could not adapt to change fast enough. Two of the most well-known case studies often cited by management experts are, of course, those of Nokia and Kodak. While the former did not see the tech world moving from hardware to software, the second did move from analog to digital but the transformation was not swift enough to keep the competitors from chipping away at its once-enviable market share.If today Manappuram Finance boasts of an AUM of Rs 31,000 crore, over 5,000 branches all over India and 44,000 employees, it wouldn’t have been possible at all without that magic ingredient of business called innovation. Pawnbroking or lending against the security of household gold jewellery has been in existence for several decades in this country but a transformation was brought into the field by infusing professionalism, modern management practices and technology into the gold loan business, which was till then a traditional business dominated by pawnbrokers and moneylenders operating in lanes and bylanes spread across the country. Manappuram became the first corporate entity in the country to enter this business and turn it into an organised and professional field. This not only paved the way for the growth of one company but an entire sector. This brought about much-needed transparency to the business, which was till then riddled with complaints of malpractices. Today, there are many NBFCs that are following on the footsteps of Manappuram and private as well as public sector banks have also woken up to the immense potential of the gold loan business. Since then, to stay ahead in the intensely competitive business scenario, Manappuram has been adopting incremental innovations with the help of technology; products such as Online Gold Loan and Doorstep Gold Loan are two such examples of innovative products that are tailormade for the modern Net-savvy customer.To progress and prosper, organisations have to continuously innovate and promote ‘intra-preneurship’. When things go smoothly, there is a tendency on the part of institutions to slip into a comfort zone and believe that their model is sustainable forever. But when a business is attractive, it is bound to attract competition. Also, when a competitor comes, he won’t just emulate but add some ‘plus’ to the product or service. It is this ‘plus’ that takes away the customer.And whatever seems a relatively safe zone can turn out to be slippery, almost overnight. To tackle this challenge, companies need to set up a specialised cell to bring about innovations based on current developments. Also, every department has to be encouraged to be innovative in its functions.For innovation to bloom, the soil needs to be right and the culture appropriate. I once headed a FICCI team that went to Israel to study the water management system there. They get very little rainfall but desalinate sea water and recycle even waste water. Since the land is barren, they employ ultra-modern agricultural techniques and are self-sufficient in most areas including food production. This is admirable, since they are always under threat because of the geo-political situation and constantly under air surveillance.I was there for a week and used to go for evening walks in the beach. Once a couple of youngsters accosted me and greeted me with, ‘Hello, uncle’. I instantly knew they were Indians and they turned out to be final semester students of IIT Powai who were doing a project at a local college there. I asked them why Israel and not the US. They told me that it is the dream of any student to do a project in that country where innovation is a way of life. People always try to do things differently there. It has become part of their culture to constantly look for innovation.Long ago, when I used to work as a banker in Chennai, I saw a different kind of innovation in raising and grooming children. Our branch was in Mint Street and our customers included members of the Gujarati community. I came to know that while celebrating children’s birthdays, they would accept small donations and with the pooled-in cash, they would buy blue chip shares in the name of the birthday boy or girl. The child would see how the share price goes up and down and watch the share’s worth swell and understand the value of money automatically.In this century, innovations are mainly driven by information technology. And technology progresses in totally unpredictable ways such as Artificial Intelligence and Metaverse. In the financial field, a lot of innovative products have become the order of the day. Even the most ordinary individuals have learned to use the e-wallet. Currencies have progressed from physical to plastic to digital. These days, the digital nature of the transactions enable the lender to assess the creditworthiness and turnover of the customer. This has led to digital, round-the-clock lending.Same is the case with any field. In medicine, complex surgeries are done by renowned experts sitting in another corner of the world, using robotics. In automobiles, they are coming up with driverless cars and intelligent cars. Innovation is now inevitable and an integral part of modern life.Innovation happens more often in startups because these are the creations of individuals who are passionate about what they do. It is like a chess player who plays for hours but does not feel tired because he is passionate about the game. An entrepreneur is also similar in his ways to the chess player and tries different ways of doing a business until he finds the best method.In large organisations, on the other hand, we create followers but it is not easy to create an innovative mindset in people, though it is not impossible. At Manappuram, we do have an internal group of people who keep their ears and eyes open to the latest technological innovations.We are all slaves of customs and practices and creativity gets blunted as we get older. This is why, large firms nowadays identify good startups and promote them. The idea is to identify someone who is driven by sheer passion rather than bring together people and create formal think tanks. Another positive development is that the Central government now allows CSR funds to be used for innovation. The IIMs and the IITs now have a startup fund and even the Kerala government has an incubation cell.India is fast becoming a global hub for unicorns and as Jeff Bezos, one of the greatest innovators the world has seen, once said, “I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.”Read More Previous News"In Manappuram, learning is a way of life” - VP NandakumarNext NewsPassion matters, not IQ or certificatesPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Passion matters, not IQ or certificates August 22, 2022Unique Times Share Says leading businessman V.P. Nandakumar, as he shares some tips for budding entrepreneursIt has been estimated that one fifth of the world’s youth are in India. Their aspirations are vastly different from that of their parents and they are not worried about basic needs unlike their forbears. This gives them the courage to take risks and it is not just a government or corporate job that many of them are after nowadays but they want to be entrepreneurs and job givers.Most successful businessmen do not have an IIT or IIM background. Their entrepreneurial mindset was shaped by the challenges they had faced in their early life. In fact, many of the big names are college dropouts.What then goes into the making of a successful businessman? Which are the qualities that lift them to the dizzy heights of success?If you ask me, there is only one prerequisite: a deep desire to build a business and the passion to do whatever it takes to execute the plan.If we look at a few successful businessmen from our part of the world, we can see that they did not learn their strategies from biz schools or management institutes. I remember Mr K M Mammen of MRF telling us during a management association meet how his granddad, Mr K M Mammen Mappillai, was against pumping in money earned from their plantation business in Kerala into their tyre business in Chennai. At best, there can be a seed fund to be leveraged on, was his advice. Similarly, leading businessman Yousuf Ali once recalled how he learned the intricacies of logistics during his initial days in the Gulf when he personally delivered goods in a career vehicle to his clients. Indra Nooyi has talked about her mother teaching her and her sister to dream big and write those dreams down. All these are home-grown strategies and not picked up from institutes or books.In my childhood, we had soda manufacturers in our state. But they did not think beyond making a living. But Pepsi and Coke made a fortune out of it. Fried chicken is what our neighbourhood thattukada (makeshift restaurant) also sells but see how KFC has turned it into an exotic product. What makes the difference is the vision.We should value money but at the same time, we should have a grand vision. When I started out in 1986, my capital was Rs 5 lakh. I had two employees, both ex-servicemen. When I used to tell them that we will go on to open 100 branches or 200 branches or 1,000 branches, they didn’t understand what I meant. So, how did the journey towards our current net worth of Rs 10,000 crore and a business of over Rs 30,000 crore happen?I am not a finance graduate. Neither have I studied accounts. When I thought of listing the company in the stock market, way back in the early nineties, no one had any clue about it. But we needed capital and therefore, we eventually got there to become the first gold loan NBFC to do so.It doesn’t matter what business you do but what is important is how you execute the plan. The gold loan wave that we triggered is what is still sweeping the credit ecosystem. The schemes that we gave shape to have gone on to become the industry’s schemes. Of course, there is risk when you do something new but the passion to reach the goal overshadows the doubts.Sometimes, I think about what would have happened if I didn’t venture into gold loans. Suppose I had opted for agri-business, I would have probably come up with half a dozen drinks from coconut water. You don’t need great knowledge or high IQ to make a mark. The desire to realise your objective will make one try different paths till the right one suggests itself.It is, however, crucial to be passionate about the idea that one pursues. There will be failures but you analyse the reasons and proceed further. During the Covid-19 phase and the resultant lull in the market, there was a dip in the revenue of our micro finance venture Asirvad. But I am confident that we will recoup and list the company at an impressive valuation in the near future. The confidence is not based on any calculation on a piece of paper but a broad vision.The story of Manappuram Finance began in Valapad village, which has now developed into a bustling town. The location doesn’t matter. We have offices elsewhere but Valapad remains our nerve centre. I don’t agree with the view that businesses have to function from big cities to survive and succeed.The first year is crucial for any start-up and many will taste failure during that phase. If a venture fails, your family and people around you will ask questions and point fingers. Why can’t you look for a job, they will ask and give unsolicited advice not to waste the rest of your money. On the other hand, if someone becomes successful, they will say that the person has become greedy!In management, they talk of three kinds of ‘sights’. Hindsight about what went right or wrong, insight into the various processes and the third and more hard-to-come-by quality called foresight on where one is headed.Research is a crucial factor in business but it is the entrepreneur’s mind that becomes its laboratory. The research will make the person try 10 things before zeroing in on the right way to the destination. This is where perseverance plays a big part.Setbacks are a part of business. In the early days, I was looking for funding but banks were not forthcoming. Then the ICICI agreed to disburse a Rs 100 crore assignment and they encouraged me to open more branches. But later they said they were not getting the go-ahead from the RBI. So, there was a crisis.Around that time, the hire purchase association had their meeting in Singapore. Most of them were vehicle financiers and as a person who did what was then an alternative business model, I got an opportunity to speak there about the gold loan business. After the session, someone tapped on my shoulder and invited me for coffee. He was a representative of Fullerton, the investment arm of the Singapore government. They had plans to invest in India and he became interested in my business model. They studied it for six months and even came down to Valapad before extending us a facility of Rs 500 crore.In business, there is a need to reinvent yourself all the time. For instance, we now have an ambitious growth plan for our jewellery chain, which faced some challenges earlier on. We already have nine showrooms and a manufacturing unit in Bangalore. Another manufacturing unit is in the pipeline in Kolkata while more branches are in the works. We will plug the loopholes but we will not let go of the core idea. Because, the real analysis is not in the board room or excel sheets but in one’s mind.Read More Previous NewsInnovation In Business: The All-Important IngredientPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Will gold duty hike be a game changer? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Will gold duty hike be a game changer? June 28, 2022Unique Times Share Tough times call for tough measures and the Union government on July 1 opted for the decisive step of raising effective import duty on gold to 15% from 10.75%. The basic customs duty on gold was 7.5 per cent and this was increased to 12.5 per cent. When agriculture infrastructure development cess (AIDC) of 2.5 per cent is added, the effective duty becomes 15 per cent. The move came in the wake of the rupee touching a new low of 78.97 against the US dollar. Despite frequent interventions by the Central Bank, the rupee has depreciated by over 5% against the dollar this year. Foreign exchange reserves are declining and the country’s trade deficit had ballooned to a whopping $24.9 billion in May from $6.53 billion in the same month last year. Burgeoning gold imports have long been perceived as a major contributor to the current account deficit. There is every justification for the government imposing a higher duty on gold imports. But what we need to consider is, what will be the fallout of this and will it have any significant impact? The rationale behind the latest move is that once the import duty is increased, the price of gold will shoot up, bringing down the demand for the yellow metal, which in turn will stanch the demand for dollars and bring down the trade deficit. According to an estimate by the World Gold Council, gold imports by India touched its highest level in a decade in 2021. Since last year, the country’s gold purchases have been escalating even further. This May alone, according to government sources, 107 tonnes of gold was imported. India, the world's second-biggest gold consumer after China, had imported gold worth $46.14 billion during 2021-22, 33.34% higher than the USD 34.62 billion imported in 2020-21. Expectedly, gold prices in the physical market rose by Rs 900 on July 1, in the wake of the duty hike, and another Rs 500 on Monday (July 3) to reach Rs 52,340 per 10 gm. There were significant gains on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India too. Subsequently, however, gold prices stabilised. The million-dollar question is whether the government’s game plan of stopping the slide of the rupee and bridging the gap between the country’s exports and imports will be successful. As we know, it is not only the outgo on gold imports that has been hitting the economy hard. The Covid crisis as also the war in Ukraine have pushed up the price of crude oil, coal, edible oil and fertilisers, causing inflation and boosting the demand for dollars. Another key question is whether the hike in customs duty will dissuade Indians from acquiring their customary quota of gold. History tells us that the answer is ‘no’. As far back as 2013, a series of curbs were brought in including serial hikes in customs duty when there was a current deficit crisis in the country. Policy makers saw gold as a villain even at that time and set about discouraging its consumption. But the demand for gold has only gone up and up. In my view, there will be demand and good sales when the collective mood is upbeat. After all, gold prices had skyrocketed to 5,200 in the past and we did not see any drop in sales because of it. Today, it is only around 4,700. Like it or not, Indians have a special fascination for the yellow metal and the country boasts of the largest stockpile of gold in the world. The centuries-old obsession is unlikely to vanish all of a sudden. As jewellers and representatives of gold merchants’ bodies have pointed out, the sudden spurt in customs duty raises the spectre of a sharp increase in gold smuggling into the country, which will result in loss of revenue for the government. When there is a significant difference in value, between unaccounted market transactions and official transactions, it is not hard to understand that it will result in an increased flow of gold through unaccounted channels. Our systems are not that fool proof. So, smuggling is bound to increase and this will defeat the government’s purpose to some extent. Yet another danger is that the money earned from illegal transactions could be used for unholy activities.I don’t expect imports to come down, since India is not a big producer of gold. There will be some revenue increase for the government but the intention of reducing the import of gold may not get fulfilled. Since there is demand, gold is likely to come in through the grey market. As for the gold loan industry, there is going to be no adverse impact. The Manappuram group had commissioned a pioneering study a decade and a half ago, which revealed that families in India had about 18,000 to 20,000 tonnes of gold. Every year, gold to the tune of 1,000 tonnes is imported. So, you are talking about 35,000-40,000 tonnes lying at Indian homes, which amounts to 60-65 per cent of the country’s GDP.Contrast this with the official loan market – banks and NBFCs – that accounts for only 1,000 tonnes of gold. The customers are either from the middle class or lower middle class. You also need to consider that the organised market constitutes only one third of the business, while the unorganised market, made up of money lenders and small-time jewellers, is estimated to be two thirds. So, there is a lot of potential yet to be tapped. Asirvad, the group’s micro finance company, lends to the poorest of the poor and even these people possess gold.Indians do not invest in gold thinking that it is a hedge against inflation. They buy gold because they attach a lot of sentimental value to it. In short, the hike is not going to impact jewelleries or gold loan companies or imports, which will happen either through official or unofficial channels.It goes without saying then that we need more imaginative strategies to ease the pressure on the rupee and the widening current account deficit.Read more Previous NewsPassion matters, not IQ or certificatesNext NewsWe will target growth of 10-15% in gold loans in coming fiscal year: VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Budget 2022: Welcome thrust on capital spend | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Budget 2022: Welcome thrust on capital spend February 05, 2022Financial ExpressManappuram Share India’s middle class feels aggrieved that recent Budgets have not extended any meaningful relief to them. Here is one concession that could have been considered which can bring down two birds with one stoneIf there is one single number from the Union Budget that catches the eye and the imagination in equal measure, it has to be 7.5 lakh crore. That’s the proposed outlay for capital expenditure during FY23, and has gone up sharply by 35.4% from the current year’s5.54 lakh crore. It is also more than double of what was spent in 2019-20. This bold thrust on infrastructure spending will hopefully crowd in private investment and is much needed at a time when the Indian economy is still finding its way out of the turmoil and stresses of the pandemic. One of the things that India got right in the response to the pandemic was to tilt towards capital expenditure that improves future supply as compared to revenue expenditure that stokes demand. This can be inflationary, as the US and other advanced economies are discovering now. Further, it is perhaps not adequately appreciated how investment in infrastructure lowers overall costs in the economy and adds to the competitiveness of local industry. It creates new markets for producers and new sources of supply spring up. These results don’t appear overnight, but the effects of the extra attention to infrastructure over the last half-decade are already beginning to show in the way India’s exports have taken off in the last one year, and how GST collections are consistently exceeding expectations these days.

Union Budget 2022: Why the informal sector needs govt support | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Union Budget 2022: Why the informal sector needs govt support January 21, 2022Business TodayManappuram Share Despite formalisation gathering pace, the informal sector continues to employ about 80% of India's labour force and produces 50% of its GDP. After the first shock of the pandemic, India's corporate sector has recovered quite well as reflected by GST collections consistently exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore in recent months and the buoyancy in the stock markets. However, it's a different story for the unorganised sector that has borne the brunt of the lockdowns and other disruptions. Despite formalisation gathering pace, the informal sector continues to employ about 80% of India's labour force and produces 50% of its GDP. To be sure, about half of them are engaged in agriculture which has held up well, thanks to good rainfall and relatively inelastic demand for food products.It is the other half, employed in the non-agricultural informal sector that is in crying need of help. Most are engaged in construction, manufacturing and in services like trade, transport, hotels, eateries etc. With activity carried out on a minuscule scale and living hand-to-mouth at the best of times, informal employers rarely have the reserves of capital to absorb unanticipated shocks. The past two years have been especially tough, and many have closed shop.

S&P upgrades Manappuram Finance's long-term credit rating to 'BB-' | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! S&P upgrades Manappuram Finance's long-term credit rating to 'BB-' October 28, 2021Economic TimesManappuram Share International rating agency S&P upgraded the long-term issuer credit rating of Manappuram Finance (MAFIL) from "B+" to "BB-" with a stable outlook. The rating agency also affirmed the 'B' short-term issuer credit rating on the company. According to the rating rationale released by S&P, the gold-based lending business of the company has proved to be an effective counterbalance to the weakness in India's microfinance segment. Manappuram Finance is expected to continue to outperform its non-gold NBFC peers over the next 12 months in terms of asset quality and profitability, which would be reflected in the company's lower credit costs, above-average profitability and strong capitalisation. In a media release, V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance said, “The upgrade reflects the overall recovery in the economy and better prospects for growth. With the unorganized sector also getting back on its feet, we expect improved growth in gold loans, microfinance, as well as, our other business verticals.” S&P also noted that Manappuram's gold-based lending model with a three-month tenor allows it to recognise asset quality stress early. However, it said stress will likely remain high in Manappuram's non-gold portfolio, especially in the microfinance business. Manappuram's funding profile is also improving with a shift towards longer tenor debt though material exposure to short-term wholesale funding remains.

Banks are a force in gold loans thanks to NBFCs | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Banks are a force in gold loans thanks to NBFCs October 01, 2021LivemintManappuram Share It is the NBFCs that have paved the way for institutional lenders to grow in this segment. But the job is still not done, and policy support is needed to draw more poor borrowers away from exploitative pawnbrokers into formalized lendingAfter the economic havoc wrought by two waves of the pandemic, India’s news media have carried many stories about how people in distress are pledging their gold jewellery to make ends meet. There was one report published by a leading national daily that particularly caught my eye. It was titled “As lockdown eases, demand for gold loans expected to surge in Tamil Nadu," and it talked about a woman named Rajalakshmi who, prior to the pandemic, had worked as a domestic help in two houses in Chennai. She then lost her job as people became averse to housemaids or outsiders entering their homes. Her husband who worked as a cook in a small restaurant also met the same fate. As her daughter’s school and her son’s college fees were due, and her savings were not enough, she ended up pledging five sovereigns of her gold which she had saved over the last four years.Here comes the part that literally made me sit up. For her gold loan, Rajalakshmi went not to one of the well-known gold loan focused non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), but to a public sector bank. The manager of the bank who also featured in the story was quoted as saying that during pre-covid times the bank had 5-7 people walking in every month to pledge gold, but now almost everyday customers were coming in to ask for gold loans. Clearly, the gold loan business at the bank was doing very well.The rise of banks in gold loans: According to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBIs) latest monthly data on sectoral deployment of bank credit, the outstanding gold loans given by banks stood at ₹62,221 crore as of 30 June 2021 compared to ₹34,267 crore a year ago, that is a jump of over 80% in just one year. (In June 2019, it stood at ₹25,405 crore.) These figures speak for themselves and there’s no denying that over the past 3 to 4 years, the banking sector has emerged as a force to reckon with in gold loans. Should this worry the gold loan focused NBFCs? Not at all. In fact, as the head of one such NBFC myself, we welcome the rise of banks in gold loans, believing strongly that their path was actually paved by the gold loan NBFCs.

In the Hot Seat Interview with Forbes Advisor India: VP Nandkumar | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! In the Hot Seat Interview with Forbes Advisor India: VP Nandkumar June 25, 2021Forbes AdvisorManappuram Share VP Nandakumar is the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Manappuram Finance Limited, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) focused on providing loans. These loans include gold loans along with home loans, personal loans, vehicle finance, small and micro finance. The 67-year-old Nandakumar has helmed Manappuram Finance, which was founded by his father, for the last 35 years. The company was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange in 1992 and currently manages assets of about INR 27,600 crore.The 67-year-old Nandakumar has helmed Manappuram Finance, which was founded by his father, for the last 35 years. The company was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange in 1992 and currently manages assets of about INR 27,600 crore.He has keen interest in farming and has multiple farms that house livestock including domestic animals, exotic birds and fishes.In an interview with Forbes Advisor India, Nandakumar spoke about how gold loans have picked up during the coronavirus pandemic and what it means for India’s savings culture.How are gold loans given to customers?The gold holding in the country is very large in quantity. Some estimates go up to the extent of 30,000 tonnes. Our official statistics itself show 800-900 tonnes of gold being imported every year. So we do have a large quantity of gold, the larger part of it gets converted into jewelry. Every year middle and low-income citizens from villages across India buy gold ornaments in small quantities from their savings. We help them monetise their precious gold jewelry by offering finance at affordable rates. Otherwise, they will invariably have to borrow at very high rates from moneylenders—something that has been common in India since many decades. Many people use a gold loan as a means for a temporary or short-term loan and would like to get back the same gold chain that they had originally pledged. The Indian psychology is different, and so the best way to monetise gold is by way of loans against jewelry.Initially, the biggest challenge faced by lenders like us was to change the perception of taking a gold loan from a distress product choice to a lifestyle product. We have been able to do it by first advertising the product via trusted celebrity endorsements to build trust and by introducing technology-driven products. With our digital gold loan product, the customer can park their gold in our branches and get a drawing power, which can be used as an overdraft limit that may be operated from anywhere using a mobile phone.For those customers who can’t reach our branches, we allow the gold loan to be disbursed to them at home. Consumers can store their ornaments with us free of cost and do not need to pay any interest unless they use it for a gold loan. If they avail a loan for a day, they needs to pay one day’s interest.

Budget 2021: Elevated fiscal deficit a concern | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Budget 2021: Elevated fiscal deficit a concern February 21, 2021Financial ExpressManappuram Share The finance minister has presented a progressive and growth-oriented budget that has also given serious consideration to some of the persistent problems of the banking and financial services sector.A bold announcement was the creation of a permanent institutional framework to invest in investment-grade securities to instil confidence in the Corporate Bond Market and improve secondary market liquidity. It will enhance the stability of the corporate bond market and, should it succeed in its objectives, it may well become the benchmark for developing the retail debt market in less developed economies. For India’s NBFC sector, it is crucial that our bond markets are strengthened so that they can rise up to become a viable alternative to bank finance. One of the lessons we have learnt from recent episodes of crises in the financial sector is that bank funding can dry up very quickly.Setting up of an ARC/AMC for cleaning the books of public sector banks is another step in the right direction. However, the institutional framework must ensure that it does not become another bank, laden with bad debt. Likewise, the setting up of a Development Financial Institution with capital of Rs 27,000 crore capital will take some of the burden of lending to infrastructure and long-gestation projects off the shoulders of banks.We are pleased that the FM has reduced the eligible loan amount for recovery under the SARFAESI Act for NBFCs. It will help in strengthening the NBFC sector by improving credit discipline among borrowers. It would have been desirable to make the limit at par with the banks, especially now that the RBI is looking to regulate large NBFCs under bank-like norms.The announcement about setting up a gold commodity exchange is laudable as it would bring much-needed transparency to the domestic gold market. The lowering of customs duty on gold from 12.5% to an effective rate of 10% reduces the incentive for smuggling. However, a sharper cut was warranted given that smuggling of gold continued to be an issue earlier, even when the duty was at 10%. We also feel some additional steps should have been taken towards monetising the 1.5 trillion dollars of gold lying idle with Indian households. Monetisation of this gold through the gold loan route would have helped provide much-needed capital without any burden on the government.Read more Previous NewsBanks to provide funds to NBFC's under TLTRO 'on tap'Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Budget 2021: 3 ways govt can increase retail participation in bond market | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Budget 2021: 3 ways govt can increase retail participation in bond market January 22, 2021Business TodayManappuram Share The solution is to deepen India's bond markets to free the NBFCs from excessive dependence on banks, and make the occasional failures (IL&FS, DHFL) less traumatic for the banking system India's NBFCs have grown their loan book at a rate of 18 per cent in the last five years, with the sector's contribution to total credit increasing from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in just three years. They play a pivotal role in meeting the financial needs of individuals and businesses that have traditionally remained underserved by banks. While NBFCs are recognised as a distinct segment, their major source of funding even today is the banks. In FY2017, borrowings from banks made up 21.2 per cent of NBFC borrowings, which jumped to 23.6 per cent in FY2018 and 29.2 per cent in FY2019. In recent years, this reliance on banks has come at the cost of inadequate funding, mainly due to deterioration in the credit profile of banks and the overall weakening of confidence in the sector following some high-profile defaults. The solution is to deepen India's bond markets to free the NBFCs from excessive dependence on banks, and make the occasional failures (IL&FS, DHFL) less traumatic for the banking system. The development of an active and liquid corporate bond market can help greatly in the transparent and efficient financing of the businesses.

Whether it realises its true potential will depend substantially on the policy measures that follow from now on.One of the immediate consequences of the lockdowns was the drying up of credit flow in the economy as banks and NBFCs became risk averse all at once. It is worth recalling that but for gold loans dispensed by NBFCs, practically every other source of credit went into a freeze for an extended period.With the Finance Minister set to present the Budget in a few weeks’ time, it is important for the government to announce measures that will unshackle the large capital held with households in the form of gold.India is home to the largest hoard of privately held gold worth about $1.5 trillion at current prices. This enormous wealth mostly lies idle while India goes capital hungry. Policy makers have for long tried, but failed, to monetise even a minuscule part of this hoard. Recent gold monetisation efforts have mostly tried to curb the fresh inflow of money into physical gold, as with the sovereign gold bonds.However, the need of the hour is to look at monetisation of physical gold lying with rural and semi-urban households where the greater part of the stock lies. The only low-cost and palatable option (i.e. without melting) to increase the monetisation of this gold is to encourage credit against the security of household gold, i.e. loans against gold jewellery or gold loans.Read more Previous NewsBudget 2021: 3 ways govt can increase retail participation in bond marketNext NewsLTV curbs on gold loans don’t helpPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

LTV curbs on gold loans don’t help | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! LTV curbs on gold loans don’t help December 31, 2020Hindu Business LineManappuram Share An LTV cap at 90 per cent for banks alone won’t help the poor looking to monetise their gold. Able NBFCs should be encouraged Recently, banks were permitted to increase the loan to value ratio (LTV) on gold loans for non-agricultural purposes to 90 per cent (from 75 per cent) till March next year. It is a welcome and, perhaps, overdue measure, not least because it acknowledges that the cap on LTV for gold loans imposed in 2012 is not etched in stone. There is no bar on banks and NBFCs extending unsecured personal loans to their customers. They can finance a vehicle up to 80 per cent and more, even when the same sheds 30 per cent of its value in the very first year. But when it comes to a gold loan, where the underlying security is immune to depreciation and almost as liquid as cash, a borrower gets only 75 per cent. The rationale for a blanket cap on the LTV ratio for gold loans was never quite clear-cut. As NBFCs were kept out of the purview of the relaxation, a section of the market interpreted the move as a setback for them. It is not so. NBFCs cater to a different class of customers compared to the banks, best described as “the top of the bottom of the pyramid.” Essentially, this class is neither destitute, nor well-off enough to interest banks. Besides, with greater last-mile reach and presence in unbanked areas, NBFCs serve customers in places where bank branches are absent.Read more Previous NewsBudget 2021 | Unshackle the gold held by India’s householdsNext NewsThe glitter onlinePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Online gold loan business is gaining traction and NBFCs want to make the most out of it | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Online gold loan business is gaining traction and NBFCs want to make the most out of it November 19, 2020Economic TimesManappuram Share The on-line gold loan remains the preferred choice for businesses and individuals even after nonbanking finance companies reopened their branches. With increased adoption of smartphones and expanding internet connectivity in rural and semi-urban India, NBFCs are aiming to get most of their customers on to the online gold loan platform.Some plan to launch co-branded prepaid cards while others are developing a semi-automated gold loan kiosk to expand the business.“The share of the online gold loan (OGL) in our total gold loan business before the lockdown was about 45% and this has now gone up to over 62%,” VP Nandakumar, managing director of Manappuram Finance, told ET. “Clearly, the lockdown period was when many of our customers realised the benefits of OGL as they were able to operate their account and borrow higher amounts, even as our branches remained closed. Even after reopening the branches, we continue to see increased adoption of OGL.” Manappuram has rolled out doorstep gold loans throughout India to extend its OGL footprint, Nandakumar added.

Why are gold loan tenures increasing during Covid? | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Why are gold loan tenures increasing during Covid? November 11, 2020Economic TimesManappuram Share An increasing number of business owners and households are recognising gold loans as a source of arranging long-term funds, which was quite uncommon previously as most such loans were closed within a year, gold loan companies said. Kerala-based non-bank finance company Indel Money has launched a gold loan product with a two-year tenure.Executive director Umesh Mohanan said: “The response so far has been quite encouraging. The gold loan demand is also being fuelled by the current credit crunch. Hence, there are ample long-term loan requirements emerging, which can be met with gold loans.” The trend is expected to continue and help the organised gold loan market grow to $62.8 billion, or about Rs 4,61,700 crore, in 2021-22 from $47 billion in 2019-20, a report released by the World Gold Council said.After the lockdown, Indel has been exploring various fundraising options to keep onward lending active and cater to the gold loan demands, Mohanan said. “We were the initial ones to perform a passthrough certificate (PTC) transaction immediately post-lockdown. We also performed India's first revolving gold loan PTC transaction to expand our gold loan book. We are also exploring co-lending opportunities as well as banking correspondence partnerships,” said Mohanan.The trend is expected to continue and help the organised gold loan market grow to $62.8 billion, or about Rs 4,61,700 crore, in 2021-22 from $47 billion in 2019-20, a report released by the World Gold Council said.After the lockdown, Indel has been exploring various fundraising options to keep onward lending active and cater to the gold loan demands, Mohanan said. “We were the initial ones to perform a passthrough certificate (PTC) transaction immediately post-lockdown. We also performed India's first revolving gold loan PTC transaction to expand our gold loan book. We are also exploring co-lending opportunities as well as banking correspondence partnerships,” said Mohanan.Manappuram Finance managing director VP Nandakumar said: “In the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, we saw an increase in gold loan offtake apparently due to the lack of availability of other credit options given the heightened risk aversion among banks and other NBFCs. But more recently, we are witnessing an uptick in gold loan demand in step with the recovery in economic activities, especially in the rural and semi-urban centres. In fact, we managed to achieve our full-year growth guidance in the half year ended September itself. With GDP growth likely to pick up, we should see good growth in business going forward as well.”Manappuram's existing gold loan products offer full flexibility to the customer to extend the gold loan tenure indefinitely. There is no restriction on the number of times the loan can be rolled over — but the interest should be settled in full at the time of rollover.Since the rollover takes place at the prevailing loan to value, any shortfall due to the mark to market is to be made good by the customer. On the other hand, if the price of gold has increased, the customer becomes eligible for a higher loan amount, said Nandakumar.Read More Previous NewsManappuram Finance Expects Gold Loan Biz to See Highest TractionNext NewsGold loan lenders glitter over yellow metal’s price surge, and borrowingsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Gold loan lenders glitter over yellow metal’s price surge, and borrowings | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold loan lenders glitter over yellow metal’s price surge, and borrowings November 08, 2020LivemintManappuram Share Gold loan providers have reaped benefits from the surge in the yellow metal’s prices, apart from the emergency borrowings triggered by the covid-19 pandemic.Both Muthoot Finance Ltd and Manappuram Finance Ltd have shown healthy growth in terms of profitability.On Friday, Manappuram Finance reported 21% growth in operating profit for the September quarter as margins remained steady and loan growth healthy. The lender has also kept its asset quality steady with gross bad loans forming just 1.11% of its total loan book.However, the future profitability of gold loan lenders hinges largely on their growth rates. The assets under management (AUM) for Manappuram Finance grew 29.6% in the September quarter for gold loans. But peer Muthoot Finance trumped that with 32% growth—its highest quarterly growth rate in a decade. In essence, Indians are borrowing more by pledging their gold with lenders. Indeed, even banks have been pushing gold loans recently. The more than 30% rise in gold prices in India so far in 2020 is also fuelling this loan growth.The management commentary has been positive from both lenders. Muthoot Finance expects its loan growth to be 15%, while Manappuram Finance, in a call with analysts, has stood by its earlier guidance of 10-15% growth.However, the AUM growth will be lower than previous years, a sign that the pandemic has not spared even gold loan providers. Much of the deceleration can be attributed to the first quarter, which was under lockdown following the coronavirus outbreak. Lenders were not able to service loan requests or collect repayments during the time.Read more Previous NewsWhy are gold loan tenures increasing during Covid?Next NewsManappuram Finance posts 10% rise in Q2 net profitPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Indians Recycled The Most Gold In At Least Eight Years In July-September Quarter | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Indians Recycled The Most Gold In At Least Eight Years In July-September Quarter November 04, 2020Bloomberg QuintManappuram Share Indian consumers recycled the most gold in at least eight years in the July-September quarter, with sales likely driven by a combination of distress on household balance sheets and higher prices for the yellow metal.Total gold recycled in India in the July- September quarter spiked to 41.5 tonnes, compared to 36.5 tonnes in the same quarter a year ago, according to data from the World Gold Council. Gold recycled rose by 13.6% over a year ago.There were a combination of reasons for the rise in recycling in the July-September 2020 quarter, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the World Gold Council in India.Somasundaram explained that there are typically three reasons for people to sell gold. First, to make money when the price of gold is attractive. Second, a distress situation where a household needs funds and can’t or doesn’t want to avail a loan. And third, in order to buy another asset.Recycling gold only because of a price rise doesn’t always make sense as customers will lose some value because of making charges or impurities in the gold.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance posts 10% rise in Q2 net profitNext NewsThe golden elephant in the roomPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

The golden elephant in the room | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! The golden elephant in the room November 03, 2020Business India MagazineManappuram Share As Covid-19 continues to spread with devastating economic consequences, something quite positive for the people of India has gone unnoticed. It’s well-known that the people of India have, over the ages, accumulated the largest hoard of private gold anywhere in the world. Estimated at about 25,000 tonnes, this gold is now worth about $1.6 trillion (at $2,000 per ounce). Before the pandemic, the same gold was worth only about $1.1 trillion.In other words, India’s households, which have seen their economic status battered by a shrivelling economy, have also collectively added about $500 billion to their wealth precisely at a time when it was most needed. The economic fallout from the pandemic has in effect generated a sizable wealth effect for our households. For a change, it is likely more pronounced for rural India, where a larger share of this gold resides.Economists have long discouraged investment in gold, arguing that it fetches no yield and, therefore, made no sense. That’s true but it misses the point that gold is not expected to yield anything. It is considered equivalent to money, and money has no yield. Investing in gold is simply a way of preserving your wealth, particularly in this age of fiat currency, where governments can print money at will. Today, the faith Indians have always had in gold has been vindicated – and not for the first time either. What’s more, a cursory reading of the tea leaves suggests conditions are ripe for gold to hold on to its gains, at least in the short to medium term. Why this is more likely requires a walk back in time to 2008.Read more Previous NewsIndians Recycled The Most Gold In At Least Eight Years In July-September QuarterNext NewsGold-loan NBFCs will see up to 18% growth in AUM in FY21Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold-loan NBFCs will see up to 18% growth in AUM in FY21 October 28, 2020Hindu Business LineManappuram Share Gold loan non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) will see a 15-18 per cent growth in assets under management in fiscal 2021 as demand for gold loans would rise with the Covid-19 pandemic-driven lockdowns being lifted slowly and economic activity clawing back, according to Crisil Ratings. Demand for gold loans would rise, especially from individuals meeting urgent personal requirements and from micro enterprises for working capital to restart businesses, the credit rating agency said. Crisil observed that gold loans would be preferred also because NBFCs and banks have tightened their underwriting norms for other loans, leading to cautious lending to micro and small enterprises, traders and the self-employed.Gold loan growth was flat in the first quarter of this fiscal for NBFCs because of low disbursements in April and May due to the country-wide lockdown.Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings, said: “Unlike other asset classes, gold loan has not faced major issues in collection and disbursement, or re-pledge of loans, barring during the stringent lockdown phase in April and May.Read more Previous NewsThe golden elephant in the roomNext NewsKerala gold loan NBFCs tap NCDs to raise funds as banks get stingyPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Kerala gold loan NBFCs tap NCDs to raise funds as banks get stingy October 21, 2020OnmanoramaManappuram Share Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in Kerala, particularly those dealing in gold loans, are overwhelmingly opting for Non-convertible debentures (NCDs) for mobilising funds. NCDs, which cannot be converted into shares, are used by corporates to raise long-term funds. In 2020, nine out of the 12 NCD issues in the country are from Kerala. This is the highest percentage of Kerala NBFCs (75%) in India going for NCDs in a year.This list is till September 30, 2020 and more NCD issues from the state are in the pipeline. Interestingly, eight of the nine NCD issues from the state are by gold loan NBFCs. So far, Kerala firms have issued NCDs for nearly Rs 1,900 crore this year. The details of NCD issue of Muthoot Finance, for which the draft was filed with SEBI on September 30, are yet to be finalised, but it is expected to be a mega offer. The previous highest percentage was in 2014, when 14 NBFCs from Kerala out of a total of 25 (56%) opted for NCDs. The percentage was 52 in 2015. Last year saw 11 NCDs of Kerala companies out of the 31. Higher success rate of NCDs is prompting Kerala companies to go for more such offers.Read more Previous NewsGold-loan NBFCs will see up to 18% growth in AUM in FY21Next NewsManappuram Finance eyes the fintech spacePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance eyes the fintech space October 05, 2020Business IndiaManappuram Share The Valapad (Thrissur) based Manappuram Finance Ltd (MFL) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs367.97 crore in its first quarter results, an increase of 37.93 per cent over Rs266.78 crore recorded in the same quarter a year ago. Net profit in the quarter for the standalone entity (which excludes subsidiaries) is Rs369.11 crore.“Consolidated profits have declined by 7.59 per cent in comparison to the preceding quarter (Q4 FY20), reflecting the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdowns. This was a quarter when the overall business environment was severely affected by the lockdowns. However, we were able to maintain growth in our core business of gold loans thanks to our digital infrastructure, particularly our robust online gold loan platform,” explains V.P. Nandakumar, MD and CEO, MFL pointing out that the company’s gold loan portfolio increased by 33.44 per cent to Rs17,736.79 crore, from Rs13,292.41 crore in the year ago quarter. While the aggregate gold loans disbursed during the quarter amounted to Rs68,389.77 crore, new customer acquisition was affected by closure of branches due to lockdowns and stood at 33,000.“The Q1 FY21 was a mixed bag for MFL wherein the dismal performance by the non-gold loan businesses – commercial vehicle (CV), micro finance (MFI) and housing finance – 30 per cent of asset under management (AUM) was covered-up by improved profitability in the mainstay gold loan business. Earnings in the gold loans business were strong, driven by healthy value-led AUM growth, substantial shift towards online gold loans (63 per cent of book) and sustained cost reduction,” states Rajiv Mehta, analyst at YES Securities targeting a price of Rs225.Read more Previous NewsKerala gold loan NBFCs tap NCDs to raise funds as banks get stingyNext NewsDemand for gold loans rises in south India despite surging Covid casesPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Demand for gold loans rises in south India despite surging Covid cases October 01, 2020Economic TimesManappuram Share Demand for gold loans has increased in Kerala since the Onam festival, even as the state is also witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases.Loan demand is strong also in other southern states, which are reporting high Covid-19 caseloads. While top executives at gold loan companies citied health-related expenses and cash demand amid job and business losses amid the pandemic as possible reasons, the region is also witnessing an upward trend in new gold purchase.The southern part of the country accounts for 40% of the country’s annual gold consumption. Jewellers said jewellery purchasing trend in Kerala was particularly strong despite rising Covid cases, as people of this southern state consider gold as one of the safest investment instruments.In 2019, India had consumed 690 tonnes of gold. Kerala alone consumed close to 70 tonnes of gold, which is about 10% of the country’s annual consumption.Malabar Gold & Diamonds chairman Ahammed MP told ET: “The demand in Kerala for gold jewellery remains unaffected and continues to be the same as last year. In this time of pandemic where cases are increasing day by day, our precautionary measures offered at our outlets are giving confidence to our customers and that confidence is getting reflected on our gold jewellery sales.”Simultaneously, the gold loan NBFCs are witnessing an uptick in gold loan demand post Onam.VP Nandakumar, the managing director of Manappuram Finance, said: “The pace of new customer acquisitions has certainly picked up in Kerala after Onam, but similar trends are observed from the other southern states as well. In fact, in September, growth in gold loans in the other southern states was more than in Kerala. We are seeing good recovery in demand from the rural and semi-urban areas of northern and western states as well.”Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance eyes the fintech spaceNext NewsCOVID-19 downturn forces some residents in India to pawn goldPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold loan businesses sparkle in Kerala despite a COVID-battered economy September 24, 2020OnmanoramaManappuram Share The economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred an unusual beneficiary – the gold loan business.As the lockdown wreaked havoc on the finances of the layman, the gold loan business emerged as an easier mode of access to finance for the needy.The business of banks and the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in the state soared, especially after the first phase of the lockdown.Initially, it was the pent-up demand generated by salary cuts and job losses that forced more people to go for gold loans.A gradual uptick in the economy saw the advent of a new class of customers including small traders and the self-employed, who desperately needed money to resume business. According to V P Nandakumar, MD and CEO of Manappuram Finance, before the pandemic, the monsoon season used to spur demand for gold loan for meeting education and medical expenses. “This year, as the schools are still closed and most medical facilities are operating at lower levels, the incremental demand comes mostly from shopkeepers and small business owners.’’ Read more Previous NewsCOVID-19 downturn forces some residents in India to pawn goldNext NewsIndian authorities face tough choices in trying to reopen economy as virus rates soarPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Indian authorities face tough choices in trying to reopen economy as virus rates soar | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Indian authorities face tough choices in trying to reopen economy as virus rates soar September 13, 2020The National, Abu DhabiManappuram Share Authorities in India are walking a tightrope as they grapple with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic alongside the need to conserve limited government finances, with Covid-19 infections continuing to surge at an alarming pace, analysts say.India's economy has been battered by the pandemic and a strict nationwide lockdown that was enforced in March in reaction to the virus. This saw many businesses virtually stop operations and millions were left without work during what was one of the strictest lockdowns in the world.The latest official data revealed that this resulted in India suffering its worst quarterly contraction on record in April to June, plunging 23.9 per cent compared to the same quarter a year earlier. That prompted Moody's Investors Service in June to downgrade India to 'Baa3' – one notch above 'junk status – from 'Baa2' for the first time in 22 years, while keeping its outlook on the country negative. “With uncertainty around Covid-19 and while the demand recovery and economy pickup is gradual, the government and the central bank have no option but to wait and see how the situation pans out before making any further announcements as they’re left with limited resources,” says Gurpreet Sidana, the chief operating officer at Religare Broking, based in New Delhi.There have been calls for more measures to be taken by prime minister Narendra Modi's government, including further fiscal stimulus, to boost the economy. But this is not something that can be easily executed, as India exceeded its fiscal deficit target for the year in the four months to July, with a shortfall of more than $111 billion (Dh407.6bn).“Given the restricted fiscal space with the central and state governments, it is difficult to see how it can be done without running up a higher deficit – which can pressure India’s external ratings,” says VP Nandakumar, the chief executive of Manappuram Finance, a non-banking financial company based in Kerala. “That is a tightrope for the government to walk.”Read more Previous NewsGold loan businesses sparkle in Kerala despite a COVID-battered economyNext NewsManappuram Finance sees gold loan portfolio growing by 10-15% in FY21Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance sees gold loan portfolio growing by 10-15% in FY21 September 05, 2020Financial ExpressManappuram Share NBFC Manappuram Finance said on Friday that gold loan portfolio is estimated to grow by 10-15% in the current fiscal despite a slowdown in new customer acquisition.VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the company, said that business is robust in the gold loan sector, but the NBFC would stick to conservative lending and focus on consolidation of the company.“Overall demand for credit has not reached the pre-Covid state. In our case, existing customers have taken more loans and compensated for the slowdown seen in new customer acquisition. Customers have also leveraged on the higher gold price,” he added.The Kerala-based lender, which also operates a home loan, microfinance and commercial vehicle leasing subsidiary, has some arrears in the non-gold loan business due to restructuring.“Around 25 % of the customers in microfinance, housing finance and vehicle leasing business have availed the moratorium. Collections in the microfinance business will cross 85% this month, collections in the vehicle finance division and housing finance is expected to touch 90% this month. We expect some credit loss in the coming quarter in this sector, but we have provided for that,” he added.New loan disbursals are lower in the non-gold portfolio and seen around 50% when compared to last year, he said. The company’s non-gold loan businesses now account for a 28-30% share of its consolidated AUM.

Gold-backed loans rise in India as price of precious metal surges to record highs August 09, 2020The National, Abu DhabiManappuram Share Gold loans company Manappuram Finance is seeing a steady rise in the number of people, mostly poor, borrowing money against their gold jewellery. The record surge in gold prices has given them an opportunity to get their hands on some extra cash to make both ends meet during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Most of our customers belong to the poorer sections [of the society],” says VP Nandakumar, managing director and chief executive of the company based in South Indian state of Kerala. “A loan against gold jewellery is perhaps the most convenient option available to them for quick and easy access to credit. These are small shopkeepers, farmers, labourers, small and medium household businesses.”Many of them “lack documents to prove regular income and therefore are unable to access formal credit from the banking system”, he says.With the rise in borrowings, the company expects its gold-backed loan portfolio to see a 10 to 15 per cent year-on-year expansion at the end of the current financial year.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance sees gold loan portfolio growing by 10-15% in FY21Next NewsIndia’s Banks Are Racing to Lend Against a $1.5 Trillion Hoard of GoldPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

India’s Banks Are Racing to Lend Against a $1.5 Trillion Hoard of Gold July 29, 2020Bloomberg QuintManappuram Share Indian families, sitting on the world’s biggest private stash of gold, are rushing to borrow against their jewelry as the precious metal rallies to records and the coronavirus pandemic fuels an economic downturn. Now, financial firms and banks are using that demand to lure more customers from pawnbrokers and money lenders.The added competition could lower borrowing costs for Indian consumers, who in desperate moments of financial stress often pay exorbitant rates to informal lenders to use gold as collateral. Firms like HDFC Bank Ltd. and Federal Bank Ltd. are expanding the loans they make against the precious metal. India’s gold lenders, such as Muthoot Finance Ltd. and Manappuram Finance Ltd., are making it easier for their clients to borrow.Manappuram is offering gold-backed loans at the customer’s doorsteps via a 24-hour bank network since people are reluctant to leave their homes while coronavirus cases are surging in India. And it has staff and vehicles on standby to service client requests.

Put your head down and play the difficult over, and there will be opportunities to score fours and sixes | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Put your head down and play the difficult over, and there will be opportunities to score fours and sixes June 26, 2020Hindu Business LineManappuram Share The Covid-19 pandemic has posed a fresh set of challenges to the already slowing Indian economy as well as to the financial services sector, which has been reeling under a huge pile of non-performing assets (NPAs) over the last few years.With the lockdown already washing out the first quarter and the pandemic showing no sign of easing, will FY21 be a year of lost opportunity for the financial sector? Will non-performing assets, which appeared to be coming under control, flare up again once the moratorium ends? What will be the impact of an one-time restructuring of debt? When will the recovery emerge?These were some of the issues that were discussed at the BusinessLine Knowledge Series Webinar, ‘Will Banks See a Second Wave of NPAs?’, moderated by Deputy Editor Surabhi on Friday.Shyam Srinivasan, MD and CEO of Federal Bank, said: “While we do not have any history or textbook reaction to deal with anything like the current pandemic, one should not think of the whole FY21 as a lost case. I think we should take our horizon up to two financial years and try to look at life beyond this period.”Drawing an cricketing analogy to highlight both the challenges and opportunities available from the pandemic, Srinivasan said: “Put your head down and play the difficult over, and there will be opportunities to score your fours and sixes.”Seconding this opinion Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director-Financial Sector & Structured Finance Ratings at CRISIL, also said one should look at the issue slightly medium-term horizon. “Within this yearApril to June will be a stressed period. With lockdown getting released in many parts of the country, we should see some element of demand pick-up coming in the second part of this fiscal in terms of economic activity as well as pent-up demand.”However, VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO of Manappuram Finance, was less optimistic. He said there is no visibility to the end of the pandemic. “The challenge is that we are not seeing the end of the tunnel. Even in case of demonetisation, we could see the end of the tunnel, but in this case, we could not see where it would end.”Read more Previous NewsIndia’s Banks Are Racing to Lend Against a $1.5 Trillion Hoard of GoldNext NewsHow to avail a gold loan?

Spike in gold loans could not enthuse individuals to pledge household gold with gold loan NBFC | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Spike in gold loans could not enthuse individuals to pledge household gold with gold loan NBFC June 16, 2020Economic TimesManappuram Share Despite a spike in gold loans in April and May, the economic uncertainty created by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the 70-day lockdown have not enthused small businesses and individuals to pledge household gold with the gold loan non-banking finance companies (NBFC) for quick money.Gold loan is mostly taken by small businesses and SME sector. Though gold loan NBFCs saw an initial surge in loan offtake when branches reopened after six weeks of lockdown, the momentum was not sustained.In April and May the increase in business volumes came more from existing customers taking advantage of higher loan-to-value (LTV) due to a spike in gold prices to increase their borrowings against existing pledges. But absolute footfalls have not increased and acquisition of new customers has not picked up.Besides, gold loan NBFCs are facing competition from the public sector banks who are giving working capital loans at 7.5%, though the NBFCs say banks take more time to process loan applications unlike NBFCs that much quicker in disbursing loans.“The cost of funds for banks is much lower than for NBFCs, hence NBFCs cannot compete with them on interest rates. However, for the customer, what the gold loan NBFCs bring to the table is ease of process and availability of credit whenever and wherever it is needed. Besides, gold loans are typically small ticket loans that get repaid within two to three months, so the rate of interest cannot be the key differentiator,” said V.P. Nandakumar, MD and CEO, Manappuram Finance.Read more Previous NewsHow to avail a gold loan?

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! All that glitters is gold as more people seek loans in strained coronavirus times June 15, 2020Times of IndiaManappuram Share At a time when there is a cash crunch in most families, and banks are hesitant to offer personal loans lest they sour, people are taking gold loans to meet their immediate requirement for money.The availability of gold jewellery at home and the ease of availing such a loan with minimum paper work and its short duration work in its favour, banking experts said.The fear of a sustained economic loss due to the pandemic and the need for quick money for basic needs is fuelling the gold loan demand, lenders said.Moreover, more money is disbursed per gram of gold depending on the carat which has customers in need of funds applying for such loans.Gold loan can be availed in the quickest and simplest way with easy documentation.Due to increased rates of gold, our bank is financing a higher amount per gram, Rs 3,150 per gm, Pune based Bank of Maharashtra said.We can also say that in June, the demand has increased compared to the pre Covid-19 situation, the official added.Lenders said many micro and small businesses are resorting to gold loans to crank up their businesses. TOI, in an earlier instance, had reported that many other loan schemes intended for MSMEs remain on paper.In the current situation, gold glitters as a ray of hope to restart many micro and small businesses. This is a viable option for SME & MSME businessmen. It fulfills the immediate need for capital. An increase in the value of gold helps the customer raise a better loanamount against the ornaments, Praveen Kutty, head of retail and SME banking, DCB Bank, said.Gold loan lending non-bank finance company, Manappuram Finance, said there was no unusual spike in people seeking gold loans with them but more people closed their loans to sell the gold in the market for higher realizations.After the first phase of lockdown, we observed that there was a spike in gold loan redemptions.We understand that many of our customers were settling their loans in order to sell their gold to jewelers and take advantage of the high price of gold, V P Nandakumar, managing director and CEO, of Manappuram Finance Limited said.Read more Previous NewsSpike in gold loans could not enthuse individuals to pledge household gold with gold loan NBFCNext NewsGold loans shine among small businessesPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Gold loans shine among small businesses | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold loans shine among small businesses June 09, 2020Times of IndiaManappuram Share There is heightened interest for gold loans among borrowers as more farmers, small merchants and businesses kick-start stalled economic activity. Gold loans are the easiest and the fastest to be processed and disburse and, with the rising rates of the yellow metal, more money is now available for the same gram. According to RBI norms, 75% of the value of pawned gold can be lent.Sample this: Private lender City Union Bank has seen a 7% spike in gold loan disbursements (when the normal average growth is 3%). Also, the average ticket size has doubled from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5-Rs 4 lakh. The demand has increased in districts that fall in green zones, like Thanjavur, Madurai and Trichy in Tamil Nadu, indicating resumption of economic activity.“We have disbursed Rs 60-crore gold loans, of which Rs 40 crore are new sanctions, in the last one month. The cost of borrowings stands at an average of 11% for gold loans and 9% for priority sector agri-gold loans,” said City Union Bank DGM R Lakshminarayan.Read more Previous NewsAll that glitters is gold as more people seek loans in strained coronavirus timesNext NewsBanks, NBFCs step up loan collection drivePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Banks, NBFCs step up loan collection drive | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Banks, NBFCs step up loan collection drive June 01, 2020LivemintManappuram Share Most financial institutions are repurposing their existing workforces to pursue their low-ticket borrowers.Banks and non-banking financial companies in India are mapping new strategies as they prepare for the challenge of recovering their retail loans amid widespread disruptions to household incomes from the coronavirus crisis.Most of these financial institutions are repurposing existing workforces to pursue their low-ticket borrowers once the lockdown measures and the six-month moratorium on loan repayments are lifted.State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s top lender, for instance, is exploring a tie-up with the Department of Posts to reach out to the bank’s massive customer base. SBI is also looking to divert its business correspondents for collection of farm loans, according to a senior bank official.Currently, SBI has nearly 60,000 business correspondents who help with opening accounts, remittances and other basic banking operations. The bank has already done a pilot project in Maharashtra, and is looking to extend this nationwide. “There is a need to have a mechanism in place to improve collection efficiency and also sensitize borrowers to repay on time. As of now, collections are done through branches. It’s time we engage with more business correspondents in this way so that there is a regular cash flow and accounts don’t go into stress," said a senior bank official, who requested anonymity.Bajaj Finance Ltd, one of the country’s largest non-bank lenders, is also looking to augment its collection capacity. In its earnings call on 19 May. the management said it has used the past two months to bolster its collection capacity.“We are adding close to 2,800 officers in the company to this activity," Rajeev Jain, managing director and chief executive officer said.Owing to the lockdown and the inability of customers to pay by cash, the bounce rate of this portfolio has surged from an average of 19% in January, February and March to about 86% in April and May.“Most borrowers, having realized that the moratorium does not waive interest and therefore would add to their interest outgo, are inclined to continue with their existing repayment arrangements. As new customer acquisition was not possible, we redeployed our staff to focus more on collections," said V.P. Nandakumar, managing director and CEO, Manappuram Finance.Read more Previous NewsGold loans shine among small businessesNext NewsCovid-19: Gold loan capacity rushes to record peaks amid the pandemicPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Covid-19: Gold loan capacity rushes to record peaks amid the pandemic May 30, 2020The Indian WireManappuram Share Small business owners, people who have not been paid by their employers and the ones who are not able to earn their daily wages in the face of the lockdown are pledging family gold to raise funds. The top-7 gold financing companies are currently holding a record loan book worth Rs 85,000 crore, as per Care Ratings data. Banks are estimated to be holding gold loans worth Rs 2.35 lakh crore.The safety vaults of leading gold finance companies and banks are filling up fast as cash-strapped individuals walk in to pawn household jewellery to save the day. The top seven gold financing companies (GFCs), which include Manappuram Finance Ltd, Muthoot Finance, IIFL Finance Ltd, Shriram City Union and Kosamattam Finance, are holding a record loan book worth Rs 85,000.While the volumes of fresh loans are rising, there is an increasing trend among borrowers to redeem gold pledged by them a few months ago. “Savvy borrowers are releasing old pledges to sell the gold in open market to take advantage of higher prices,” said Nandakumar of Manappuram.“I believe this phase is more like a reboot than a lockdown as most businesses are now allowed to resume operations, albeit with some restrictions on staffing. We started reopening our branches from April 20 and about 80% of our branches are working now. We expect our gold loan business to revert to normalcy once public transport resumes and local travel becomes easier”. said Nandakumar.Read more Previous NewsBanks, NBFCs step up loan collection driveNext NewsGold Financing on the rise in times of lockdownPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Over 90% gold loan customers have not opted for moratorium: VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO, Manappuram Finance May 08, 2020Financial ExpressManappuram Share In the gold loan category, which accounts for 87% of our standalone portfolio, more than 90% are servicing their dues.In the gold loan category, which accounts for 87% of the standalone portfolio at Manappuram Finance, over 90% customers are servicing their dues without opting for the moratorium, said MD & CEO VP Nandakumar in an interview with Hariprasad Radhakrishnan. He further said physical distancing is here to stay, which would lead to increased adoption of digital and phygital modes of business, adding that the company disbursed loans worth Rs 200 crore online during the lockdown to existing customers whose gold is already pledged with the company. Edited excerpts:How do you think lockdown 3.0 will be different for your business?I believe this phase is more like a reboot than a lockdown as most businesses are now allowed to resume operations, albeit with some restrictions on staffing. We started reopening our branches from April 20 and about 80% of our branches are working now. We expect our gold loan business to revert to normalcy once public transport resumes and local travel becomes easier.What is your assessment of the business impact over the past two months?In the first phase of the lockdown, all our branches remained closed and therefore, no new customers could be acquired. However, we were able to keep the momentum going with repayments and renewal of gold loan pledges taking place through our various digital channels, including the online gold loan platform. We succeeded in increasing our gold loan portfolio by over Rs 200 crore during the lockdown by relying on existing customers using our online gold loan platform to increase their borrowings against gold already pledged with us. Of course, we were also helped by the sharp increase in gold price that allowed customers room to borrow more against their existing pledges.What share of your borrowers have opted for the moratorium?Most of our customers have preferred not to opt for the moratorium as they realise deferment of repayments without waiver of interest would add to their interest outflow. In the gold loan category, which accounts for 87% of our standalone portfolio, more than 90% are servicing their dues. In vehicle finance and other smaller verticals, collections are improving day by day and currently amount to over 40% of the billing. We expect significant improvements once economic activities resume in full swing.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance Q4 results: Net profit jumps 44% to Rs 398 croreNext NewsManappuram disburses Rs 300 crore gold loans amid lockdown via digital channelsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Rush for Gold Loans Seen as Indians Seek Refuge on Slowdown | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Rush for Gold Loans Seen as Indians Seek Refuge on Slowdown April 30, 2020Bloomberg QuintManappuram Share Indians may borrow more against their stash of gold as the world’s biggest lockdown raises financial stress in an economy that’s set for its first contraction in four decades. Indians are the biggest consumers of gold after China and hold the largest hoard of the precious metal. Gold is both an insurance policy and a retirement plan in a country that lacks robust social welfare systems or widespread access to formal credit. And with economic activity coming to a virtual standstill after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a 40-day nationwide lockdown to combat the coronavirus, more Indians are likely to turn to gold loan companies to raise money against the precious metal.“Recycling and collateralized loans against gold may be expected to grow exponentially in the next few quarters,” P.R. Somasundaram, managing director for India at the World Gold Council, said in an interview. “There will definitely be a strong growth in that area for two reasons: the prices are going up -- they will get more for the same grammage -- and the second is that banks are not going to be in a position to lend just like that.” Previous NewsGold loan firms see opportunity to lend as banks turn risk averseNext NewsGold loans record faster growth than other retail loan productsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold loans record faster growth than other retail loan products April 29, 2020Economic TimesManappuram Share Gold loans – backed by gold ornaments as collateral – are gaining traction faster than other retail loan products in the changing contours of finance during the lockdown. Rising gold prices have also turned out to be a boon for this market as borrowers become eligible for higher loan amounts.Both lenders and borrowers are zeroing in on this time-tested financial tool with the economy at a near standstill following the Covid-19 outbreak. For lenders, it’s the safest asset class to boost revenue and earnings even as the risk profile of borrowers deteriorates with falling income levels. For borrowers, it’s the easiest option to meet short-term needs.“During periods of economic downturn, banks and NBFCs (Non banking finance companies) alike become risk averse and lending slows down. It is, therefore, likely that the demand for gold loans may rise in the aftermath of the lockdown,” said VP Nandakumar, managing director of Manappuram Finance, an NBFC with gold loans as its principal business.Read more Previous NewsRush for Gold Loans Seen as Indians Seek Refuge on SlowdownNext NewsLoan moratorium: Lenders struggling to trace low-ticket retail borrowersPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! NBFCs, HFCs welcome RBI move on improving liquidity April 17, 2020Hindu Business LineManappuram Share Banks may have to take call on extension of moratoriumThe slew of announcements by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday seem to have addressed a majority of concerns of non-banking finance companies (NBFC) and micro finance players although it did not resolve the issue of extending a moratorium to them.Sources close to the development said that banks may take a call on whether or not to extend the moratorium to NBFCs and MFIs. The Indian Banks’ Association may discuss the issue in the coming days. “The RBI announcements on liquidity have taken care of about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of concerns of NBFCs. We are awaiting the operational guidelines to get a better understanding,” said Mahesh Thakkar, Director General, Finance Industry Development Council.CARE Ratings said that many NBFCs and housing finance companies are in talks with their banks to avail the moratorium, however, it is not an automatic decision from the banks and there may be a differential behaviour by banks.“The RBI, however, has announced measures like the Targeted Long Term Repo Operations 2.0 and funding being made available to the likes of SIDBI, NABARD & NHB for on-lending to NBFCs/HFCs. These measures would help channel some liquidity to NBFCs/HFCs,” it said. The challenge is post the moratorium period, assuming the country-wide lockdowns end by May 2020 and businesses start to operate, it may take some time for collection efficiencies to reach normal levels, it noted.Lakshmi Iyer, Chief Investment Officer (Debt) and Head Products, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company also said the announcement of the TLRTO 2 directed towards the NBFC sector is a much needed initiative given the Covid related moratorium optionality that this sector had to offer its borrowers. “This should allow for more broad based availability of liquidity under this facility,” she said.VP Nandakumar, Managing Director and CEO of Manappuram Finance said the size of the TLRTO may have to be increased going forward.Read more Previous NewsV.

Amid coronavirus lockdown, gold finance companies may be less impacted | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Amid coronavirus lockdown, gold finance companies may be less impacted April 20, 2020Business StandardManappuram Share Backing of a liquid collateral and pricing power augur wellAt a time when the country is reeling from the impact of the global outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19), non-banking financial company (NBFC) stocks were among the worst hit. Their performance is expected to be hit due to stress across sectors. While these concerns are justified, gold finance companies — Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Finance — may be less impacted.There is no doubt that both financiers have also faced operational disruption due to the lockdown; they have shut their branches. There could be some asset quality pressure as well. However, the highly liquid collateral (gold)-backed loans with typical asset tenure of less than 12 months and pricing power (to pass on higher costs) should augur well.“The safety of money is most important in the current situation, when the degree of impact of Covid-19 is very difficult to ascertain. Nobody is able to estimate how long it will last. I think, gold finance companies are a better and safer choice among NBFCs,” says Deepak Jasani, head of research-retail, HDFC Securities.Read more Previous NewsNBFCs, HFCs welcome RBI move on improving liquidityNext NewsUnion Budget 2020: Investors deserve their fair sharePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Union Budget 2020: Investors deserve their fair share | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Union Budget 2020: Investors deserve their fair share January 31, 2020Deccan HeraldManappuram Share The key to bringing India’s economic growth back on track is to rekindle the animal spirits of entrepreneurs, including the small and marginal entrepreneurs. An economy needs investments to grow, and investments need the savings tap to flow without friction.The forthcoming Union Budget must address the issue of how to improve the flow of savings to investments, whether in the form of equity or debt. Earlier, only equity capital was thought to take on the risks in business and hence deserving of preferential tax treatment, which led to differentiated capital gains taxation for equity as against regular income tax for interest income. However, if the experience of the past several quarters have taught us anything, it is that even debt capital takes on business risk, maybe not as much as equity but significant none the less. Several savers(investors)in Co-operative Banks, NBFCs, and corporates have faced the brunt of businesses failing to honour their commitment and repay their dues. It is time that policymakers took another look at the long-standing presumption that only equity investment is about risk-taking while debt investments are risk-averse.Read more Previous NewsAmid coronavirus lockdown, gold finance companies may be less impactedNext NewsQ3 result: Manappuram Finance net profit rises 63% to Rs 398 cr, AUM up 35%Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Gold backed micro-loans for India’s undocumented workers | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold backed micro-loans for India’s undocumented workers January 24, 2020Financial ExpressManappuram Share A gold loan is like a credit card for people working in the unorganized sector, which gives them money whenever they need it.As per the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey, the majority of Indian households operate in the informal segment. About 68 per cent of the non-crop growing workers were engaged in the informal sector. Among regular wage/salaried employees in the non-agriculture sector, 71 per cent had no written job contract, 54 per cent were not eligible for paid leave, and 50 per cent were not eligible for any social security benefit.Most of these people would find it next to impossible to get any loan from banks, which pushes them towards informal lending channels and moneylenders. Banks and other institutional lenders are stuck with inflexible risk underwriting practices and find it challenging to deliver credit to those at the bottom of the pyramid, effectively denying them the opportunity to play their assigned role in a growing economy. Bear in mind that of the 68 per cent engaged in the non-crop growing informal sector, most (71 per cent) don’t have a written job contract. That accounts for nearly 48 per cent of the total working population!Innovation is the key to addressing the challenges faced in extending credit to this class of borrowers. Microfinance lending is perhaps the only large scale lending mechanism which has addressed the underwriting challenges to some extent through the group lending structure. RBI too acknowledged the contributions made by MFIs in strengthening credit to those at the bottom of the economic pyramid and increased the income limit for borrowers from the earlier Rs 1 lakh per annum to Rs 1.25 lakh (for rural areas) and from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 2 lakh per annum for urban and semi-urban areas. Likewise, the lending cap for microfinance institutions was raised to Rs 1.25 lakh, against the earlier limit of Rs 1 lakh.Read more Previous NewsQ3 result: Manappuram Finance net profit rises 63% to Rs 398 cr, AUM up 35%Next NewsBudget 2020: NBFCs offering gold loans can meet part of unmet credit demand, boost growth; here's howPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Budget 2020: NBFCs offering gold loans can meet part of unmet credit demand, boost growth; here's how | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Budget 2020: NBFCs offering gold loans can meet part of unmet credit demand, boost growth; here's how January 22, 2020FirstpostManappuram Share Gold loans extended to agrarian borrowers by the banks enjoy the priority sector lending (PSL) status, no such benefit is available to NBFCsGold loans provided by NBFCs should get equal and fair treatment at par with the banksIt is time that gold loan NBFCs got its due share of support from the policymaking establishmentIn the forthcoming Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be required to address several challenges, but the highest priority should go towards reviving growth.Keeping aside the debate of structural versus cyclical slow-down, the economy has slowed down sharply over the past few quarters, amid challenges in the banking and NBFC sectors, low demand and job losses. While the bigger players have not faced the brunt of the credit squeeze, the situation for the smaller players is dire.Banks are flush with money yet unwilling to take a risk and lend to smaller businesses, especially to MSMEs, traders, shopkeepers, etc., the strata most vulnerable to liquidity stress. While the big borrowers were able to approach the global markets, the smaller businesses have suffered. The recent surge in international borrowings by an increasing number of established players suggests that despite the vast liquidity infused into the economy by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks aren’t willing to loosen their purse strings yet.In times like these, when entrepreneurs are starving for credit from Banks, the finance minister should do everything possible to enable NBFCs to step up their lending to marginal borrowers.Here are a few suggestions that would facilitate NBFCs, especially gold loan lenders, to fulfil at least a part of the sizeable unmet credit demand and thus do their bit to revive economic growth:Gold loans are mainly used by people in rural or semi-urban areas, who borrow by pledging their used household jewellery as they don’t have access to any other forms of institutional credit. Gold loans are typically microloans of less than Rs 50,000 ticket size. In this context, the present regulatory dispensation is discriminatory towards NBFCs, as banks are given preferential treatment.Read more Previous NewsGold backed micro-loans for India’s undocumented workersNext NewsInterview: Senthil Kumar, Head of Commercial Vehicle, Manappuram FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Interview: Senthil Kumar, Head of Commercial Vehicle, Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Interview: Senthil Kumar, Head of Commercial Vehicle, Manappuram Finance January 13, 2020TRUCKSDEKHOManappuram Share In an exclusive interview with Trucksdekho, the CV head at Manappuram finance elaborate the factors impacting the domestic CV industry, the importance of financing for trucks, how the company is growing in the commercial vehicle finance business, and the potential in the CV segment.The automotive industry and the commercial vehicles sector is going through one of its toughest time. Could you give us an overview of the CV market?The Indian auto industry is going through a difficult phase of falling sales and inventory build-up. The industry clocked double-digit growth of 14.2 %in 2017-18, bouncing back from the effects of demonetisation and GST. Although the initial months of 2018-19 witnessed good growth, it slowed down to single digits towards the middle of the year and rapidly lapsed into a drop in volumes as the year drew to a close, leading to production cuts.The finance minister announced a stimulus package for the industry assuaging the negative sentiments though it might not change things on the ground immediately. Rising fuel costs, erratic monsoon, and lower farm prices dented rural sales. Commercial vehicle sales began feeling the heat due to two reasons: one, quicker turnaround times after GST, and two, the permission to carry higher loads for existing vehicles. In July/August 2018, the government increased the axle load limit for all trucks, increasing the operational freight capacity by 20-25 %, roughly equivalent to three years of incremental freight demand. The downtrend began from the festival season of last year.Dealers who usually load up on inventory to meet the festive season demand saw limited offtakes and were left with piles of unsold stock, as dispatches from manufacturers continued in the hope of a revival. Estimates by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) in February 2019, show inventory levels touched a peak 50-60 days for passenger vehicles, 80-90 days for two-wheelers and 45-50 days for commercial vehicles.A far cry from the ideal level of three weeks or 21 days inventory advocated by the body. This necessitated production cuts from manufacturers and led to retrenchment. As of July 2019, average inventory for passenger vehicles came down to 25-30 days, thanks to production cuts and lower dispatches to dealers. The average inventory for two-wheelers ranged from 60-65 days and for CVs, from 55-60 days. Barring cars, the inventory levels for two-wheelers and commercial vehicles continue to be high even today.Read more Previous NewsBudget 2020: NBFCs offering gold loans can meet part of unmet credit demand, boost growth; here's howNext NewsManappuram Finance raises $300 million in three-year bondsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Tightening the leash November 11, 2019The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share Excessive NBFC regulations will stifle innovation After the IL&FS debacle, NBFCs have come under the microscope of regulators, investors, analysts and the wider public. Predictably, there are calls for further tightening of regulations in the belief that it will somehow improve matters.To get to the crux of the issue, let’s begin by asking, why do NBFCs exist? After all, it should theoretically be possible for banks to take over this space. But then, the banking system’s coverage has well-known gaps that exclude large sections, precisely the failing that has allowed non-banks to thrive.A case in point is loans against second-hand trucks, by logic a troublesome asset to finance. It depreciates rapidly and you cannot pinpoint the location of the asset for sure. A regulator evaluating this business would see red flags everywhere. And yet, Shriram Transport Finance plunged headlong and triumphed by learning the nitty-gritty of the trade and building an entire eco-system around it.Read more Previous NewsHappy New Year!

India’s pot of gold | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! India’s pot of gold August 30, 2019The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share Domestic monetisation efforts due for a revampExactly how much gold India has accumulated over the years is a matter of much speculation. Considering the $340-billion worth of gold imported in the current decade itself, the total number should easily be worth over a trillion dollars. In 2013, a surge in gold imports aggravated India’s current account deficit, and revived interest in mobilisation of domestic gold to reduce imports. The existing Gold Deposit Scheme (1999) and the Gold Metal Loan Scheme (1998) were found ineffective, and so the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) was launched in 2015 to increase mobilisation of domestic gold. However, the response since has been tepid, calling for a fresh look.Here is one way to revive the flagging GMS: Allow gold loan providers (banks and NBFCs) to participate in the GMS through the gold pledged with them in default accounts. Currently, gold loan financiers are required to auction this jewellery on an “as-is-where-is” basis. Melting jewellery to determine purity is not permitted. Consequently, bidders at auctions exercise undue caution and bid lower than the real value of the jewellery (classic lemon market/asymmetry of information). Borrowers lose because their jewellery gets sold for less than market value, and with the GST also payable, the auction surplus, which otherwise comes back to them, is often wiped out.If gold loan providers are allowed to deposit into the GMS collateral gold held against accounts in default, it would be a win-win for all. The actual value of the customer’s gold jewellery will be independently assessed by a credible third party upon melting at any authorised collection and purity testing centre, without extra cost or tax. The financiers will gain from lower operating costs and timely realisation. And the GMS, which has mobilised only about 15 tonnes of gold since 2015 (less than what the three largest gold loan NBFCs auction in a year), gains from volumes.Read more Previous NewsCrisil upgrades Manappuram Finance rating to 'AA'Next NewsEased lending norms may cut borrowing cost: VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Eased lending norms may cut borrowing cost: VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Eased lending norms may cut borrowing cost: VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance August 29, 2019Financial ExpressManappuram Share The gold loan business is mostly unaffected by the day-to-day volatility in gold prices.Gold loan major Manappuram Finance expects to get funds from banks for on-lending. However, the company will continue to raise funds through NCDs and from overseas markets to diversify its borrowing portfolio, VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO, tells Vinayak Aggarwal and Shashank Nayar.Has the rise in gold prices affected demand for gold loans?The gold loan business is mostly unaffected by the day-to-day volatility in gold prices. However, in a scenario of consistently rising prices, we may get an initial pick-up in demand coming from small and marginal borrowers attracted by the higher loan amount. Our observation is that this is not usually sustained as higher prices soon become the new normal.The other important aspect is that customers avail gold loans based on their needs. Generally, they are not tempted to borrow more just because with higher gold prices the available loan amount is also higher. In fact, with some borrowers, it can also happen that higher gold prices lead to a pledge of a lower quantity of gold. Our current gold loan book LTV is only about 62%, well below the regulatory ceiling of 75%.The borrowing costs amount to 9.27%, in line with the cost for other AA-rated NBFCs. Do you see costs going down? Also, are you considering NCDs or overseas issuance of bonds to raise capital?In Q1 of this year, our weighted average cost of borrowing went up by 7 bps to 9.34%, but this was more due to long-term loans we recently availed as part of our strategy to further strengthen ALM. We have the approval to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore via NCD, of which we have raised about Rs 400 crore only. To further diversify our borrowing profile, we would continue to raise funds via money market instruments, NCDs, term loans from financial institutions, and also overseas borrowings depending on the cost.

The budget will set the tone for the next five years and offer insights into its thinking and critical focus areas. This union budget is significant as it will be the first statement of intent of the government on a host of critical issues, such as the stress in the financial sector affecting banks and non-banks alike, farm prices, employment creation, trade wars, protectionism etc. The Finance minister will, as always, have to walk a tight rope between fiscal prudence and spending on social welfare.In this context, we at Manappuram Finance would request the FM to address some valid concerns affecting our industry, as listed below.1. Alignment of the Income Tax Act with RBI’s regulations: While the Reserve Bank of India is looking to harmonise regulations for Banks and NBFCs, the Income Tax Act continues to differentiate.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance posts 35% growth in Q1 consolidated net profitNext NewsBudget 2019: Gold loan industry expects these 2 things from Nirmala SitharamanPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Budget 2019: Gold loan industry expects these 2 things from Nirmala Sitharaman | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Budget 2019: Gold loan industry expects these 2 things from Nirmala Sitharaman June 26, 2019Financial ExpressManappuram Share The gold loan sector has been at the forefront of the Indian government’s effort to bring more people into the ambit of formal finance. Besides, the industry also contributes to the monetisation of India’s vast stock of private gold through the credit route. The gold loan is typically a small ticket loan, often given to customers in a rural or semi-urban area, against their household jewellery. These loans are taken by people who don’t have access to any other form of formal credit. At Manappuram Finance Limited, for instance, almost two-thirds of our loans against gold are microloans of amounts less than Rs 50,000.And yet, even as India sits atop the largest stockpile of privately held gold in the world, there are some roadblocks which prevent the industry from contributing its full might to the economy. What should the government and the regulators do to ease the way? Here are a couple of suggestions which can be considered in the forthcoming budget.Introduction of risk weights based mechanism to replace the LTV capAt present, the Gold loan companies can lend only up to 75 percent of the value of Gold in jewellery. To a borrower holding a meagre quantity of gold, a cap on the maximum loan he can avail is counterproductive. It also goes against the government’s stated mission of furthering financial inclusion. The unorganised sector, which faces no such restriction, is winning back marginal borrowers with the promise of higher loan to value (LTV).Read more Previous NewsBudget 2019: Give priority sector status to gold loansNext NewsLift cap on gold loansPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Lift cap on gold loans June 20, 2019The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share This will help boost lending to micro-unitsIn the post-monetary policy briefing on April 4, the RBI governor highlighted the uneven flow of credit to MSMEs. He pointed out that bank credit growth to micro and small industries was flat at 0.6 per cent, as was credit to medium units (growth of 0.7 per cent), against overall credit growth of 14 per cent.It begs the question: Why is it that critical sectors such as MSME are still unable to access credit? What more should regulators do to ease credit flow to small borrowers? After all, these are the people who often find themselves falling back on informal moneylenders for their credit needs. Reducing the policy rate by 25 basis points is not enough.Credit challengesMicro-enterprises, the backbone of the Indian economy, face challenges in raising credit from formal sources as they often lack documentary evidence of their creditworthiness. For them, the cost of the loan is not so significant as the availability of credit itself. However, banks face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of micro-enterprises, which often work from homes, employ family members, and operate on a cash basis. How can a bank evaluate their credit requirement and repayment ability?Read more Previous NewsBudget 2019: Gold loan industry expects these 2 things from Nirmala SitharamanNext NewsFinancing MSMEs: The continuing challengePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Financing MSMEs: The continuing challenge June 07, 2019Fortune IndiaManappuram Share The performance of banks in rural and MSME lending has been inadequate even after the considerable expansion of the scope of priority-sector loans.Access to finance is a critical requirement for economic development, especially at micro-entrepreneurial levels. India is yet to evolve a dependable mechanism for providing credit to the needy, forcing many to approach moneylenders. A 2018 IFC study reports that formal sources of finance cater to only 16% of the total MSME debt financing — the rest is either self-financed or availed from informal sources — down from 22% in 2012.Moneylenders target mainly, small and marginal farmers, daily wage-earners, self-employed and unorganised sector entrepreneurs, urban slum dwellers, and migrants etc. Poor households often find themselves dependent on informal credit for their needs for investment or consumption. Small-scale entrepreneurs often fall back on moneylenders for working capital, borrowing on a daily or weekly basis at exorbitant interest rates. They suffer frequent shocks to their income forcing them to borrow to maintain their precarious livelihood. With limited resources for plying their trade, they need access to credit, but given the informal nature of their activity, a loan from the banking sector is hard to come by.Read more Previous NewsLift cap on gold loansNext NewsWorld Bank to invest $35 million in Manapurram FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Looking for a short-term loan? Here’s a better alternative | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Looking for a short-term loan? Here’s a better alternative May 16, 2019Financial ExpressManappuram Share There is one credit product which works like an overdraft account where you can borrow as and when needed, for as long as you want!We often come face to face with situations when we need money for short periods, but don’t have ready cash. When such expenses can be paid by a credit card, we may do that, but often we need hard cash to meet pressing expenses such as school fees, medical bills, or other unforeseen contingencies. In such situations, the most commonly used form of credit is a personal loan. Most institutions extend a personal loan based on your credit score, income proof and assorted documentation. A personal loan works well if you can space out the repayment schedule by EMIs over 12 to 24 months. What if you require the loan for a short period, say a few days, or a couple of months only? A personal loan will simply not fit the bill.There is one credit product which works like an overdraft account where you can borrow as and when needed, for as long as you want! You can enjoy the loan for days, months, even years, without any EMIs to honour. All you have to do is pay the interest falling due in the account regularly. It is widely used in southern India, but is yet to pick up in other parts of the country. It is the loan against gold jewellery, or gold loan. The best part about a gold loan is that there is no rigid schedule of EMIs as it comes with a bullet repayment plan. And you can close the loan even after one day, without any pre-payment penalty.Read more Previous NewsWorld Bank to invest $35 million in Manapurram FinanceNext NewsWhy millennials should opt for gold loans to fund personal needsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Why millennials should opt for gold loans to fund personal needs April 12, 2019Financial ExpressManappuram Share As times are changing, gold loans are fast shedding their traditional tag and embracing the technology to appeal to the millennial user.It is no secret that India is a young country. Young Indians are making their mark across the globe in every field and are making the country proud. Like with everything else, if there is one word that could be used to characterize this generation, it will be “Instant”.The instant generation or the millennials have been defined by experts across the globe. I shall not venture into that territory. My intervention today is to tell you how a product like gold loan, which has been associated with the poor and rural people, is more suited to the instant and urban populace, we have come to recognize as the millennials.Traditionally, when gold loan as a product was born, it was a product for the poor. It gave them the liberty to monetize household gold deposits and offered instant cash in the direst of situations. However, as time has passed, fruits of economic progress have reached the interiors of our country. Farmers are now more educated and use the latest technology to carry out transactions for their day-to-day business needs. The gold loan product has also evolved and made itself future-ready.Read more Previous NewsLooking for a short-term loan?

Harmonising NBFCs | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Harmonising NBFCs February 25, 2019The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share Needed, a new risk-weight mechanismThe RBI recently spoke about working towards harmonisation of the various categories of NBFCs involved in credit intermediation.This is a welcome step. Of the more than 10,000 NBFCs operating in India, 95 per cent are non-deposit taking. The others include asset financing, micro-finance, and core investment companies.Too many categories only increase compliance cost for the industry and monitoring cost for the regulator. When the RBI releases the guidelines for harmonised entities later this month, it will recognise only two categories, NBFCs and CICs. The effects of the harmonised regulations could have far-reaching implications for the future growth and business direction of NBFCs.The key questions that the RBI should address are: Should we have the same set of regulations for all NBFCs even as they vary widely in their business focus and sources of funding? How do you enforce prudential risk measures for each asset class, while preventing distortionary anomalies from arising post implementation of ‘activity based’ regulations? And, should banks and NBFCs engaged in similar activities operate under equitable, non-discriminatory regulations?Separate regulations for each activity that an entity is involved in would increase compliance cost, which will hit smaller players more. On activity-based regulations, there is a need to differentiate between assets based on inherent risks. Risk weights could then be prescribed based on the quality of asset and tenure.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance offers Doorstep gold loan in Delhi, MumbaiNext NewsManappuram Finance Q3 profit up 42%Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Budget 2019: Levy lower tax rates on cashless transactions to encourage more people to use digital payment mode January 24, 2019FirstpostManappuram Share With the date for budget 2019 is drawing nearer, most of the spokespersons for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are focusing on what more the government should do to address the acute pressures on the liquidity front that India’s NBFCs have been facing since the IL&FS crisis story uncovered last year. Various estimates suggest that NBFCs cater to 30-45 percent of the total credit in India.While important steps have been taken to ensure NBFC funding is not affected, a lot more needs to be done to ensure NBFCs get back into the growth mode so that credit flow to the informal sector of the economy does not get choked. However, in this post, I will focus on three aspects relevant to NBFCs where I believe the budget can, and should, make a difference.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance Q3 profit up 42%Next NewsAsirvad Microfinance securitises MF portfolioPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Banking On The Yellow Metal | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Banking On The Yellow Metal June 18, 2018BusinessworldManappuram Share How Nandakumar changed the contours of the gold loan business and is now set to make it big in the world of microfinanceWhat rings in your mind when you hear of Manappuram Finance? The humble yet effective TV ad featuring actor Akshay Kumar. The Kerala-based Manappuram Finance was one of the first companies to start offering loan against gold. And their target audience has been clearly the less well-to-do customers, who in times of need have to fall back on moneylenders.“My long-term plan is to see Manappuram Finance emerge as a well- diversified financial services company driven by technology and catering to the credit requirements of the less well-off sections of the society,” says V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the company.Under the aegis of Nanadakumar, the company in 1998 entered the gold loan business, which was hitherto dominated by the unorganised sector including money lenders and local jewellers. Prior to this, the company, founded by Nandakumar’s father V.C. Padmanabhan, was focused on leasing, hire purchase and general finance.Nandakumar, for the first time, injected technology, innovation and modern management practices to this business, which went on to change contours of the gold loan business.The company has grown from being niche south India- based small outfit to a full blown company with pan India presence. It has over 4,185 branches across 23 States and four Union Territories with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 146.50 billion and an employee count of over 20,000.Recently, the company forayed into microfinance, vehicle and housing finance, and SME lending. The move into microfinance was followed by the acquisition of the Chennai-based Asirvad Microfinance in February 2015. In 2013, the going had become tough for Manappuram with a sharp fall in gold price. This accelerated defaults leading to erosion in profitability. For Nandakumar, the rough patch was an eye opener and he realised that exclusive focus on gold loans would make the company vulnerable to gold price fluctuations and other volatility specific to the industry such as changes in regulatory norms.That is when Nandakumar decided to diversify and get into new businesses such as microfinance, home loans, vehicle loans and SME lending. Nandakumar has won several laurels and awards for his achievements. He is a managing committee member of industry bodies such as Assocham, Ficci and FIDC.Read more Previous NewsAward for Manmohan SinghNext NewsPoliticians, don’t bash the business classPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Politicians, don’t bash the business class May 24, 2018Hindu Business LineManappuram Share Political parties that do not deliver on the economic front are bound to bite the dust during electionsThere’s no doubting the resurgence in the fortunes of India’s political opposition following the better than expected performance in Gujarat and some hard-fought successes in recent by-elections. And now, there’s the relatively strong showing in Karnataka albeit more in terms of vote share than seats. It is a welcome development because democracy works best when a strong and decisive government in power is complemented, and held to account, by a strong and effective opposition.At the same time it was disturbing to hear the Opposition parties, during their electoral campaign in Gujarat, taking pot shots at the business class, in a throw back of an earlier era.Read more Previous NewsBanking On The Yellow MetalNext NewsMr. V.

The flip side to a formalised economy | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! The flip side to a formalised economy January 18, 2018Hindu Business LineManappuram Share A forced shift from the informal to the formal sector can lead to job losses. But labour reforms can smoothen the transitionFollowing the twin strikes of demonetisation and GST, commentaries on India’s economic outlook have frequently highlighted the two emerging trends of financialisation of savings and formalisation of the economy as factors set to hasten growth in the coming years.Financialisation of savings — the shift towards formal channels of savings — is indeed an unmixed blessing for the economy.Recent months have seen a surge of money flowing into the banking system and into mutual funds, insurance, etc. That has helped lower interest rates and brightened prospects of more lending by banks. The rush of money into the equity markets will make it easier for entrepreneurs to raise funds from the capital markets.Besides, the persistent attraction of gold as a form of savings will likely fade, which is good for India’s balance of trade.However, when it comes to formalisation of the economy — the shift of output and employment from the unorganised, informal to the organised, formal sector — the picture is clouded.Read more Previous NewsMr. V.

Why investment in gold makes sense | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Why investment in gold makes sense October 22, 2017Deccan HeraldManappuram Share India is the largest consumer of gold in the world. Our love affair with the metal is age old. Roughly 800 to 900 tonnes, about a third of the total gold mined in the world, is consumed in India.Domestic production being negligible, we are the largest importers of gold. The Indian attachment to gold is a product of our history. Gold is rare, beautiful and stable. It does not depreciate in value nor deteriorate in quality with time. It is compact and can be carried around with ease. It can be buried underground without loss of quality or quantity.Gold is therefore permanent, portable and easily-hidden wealth. In the olden days, when property rights were not secure gold was the most sensible way to accumulate wealth. Along the way, it became part of our culture and tradition.Many of our traditions have changed over the years, but large scale purchases of gold during weddings and festivals continue.While people have been investing in gold for ages, in the last few decades we have seen new avenues for investment emerge that give present day investors a range of options not available in earlier days. No doubt, each of these options has its own advantages, disadvantages and risks, which have to be kept in mind along with the investor’s own circumstances while making a choice. According to a recent nationwide debt and investment survey, an average Indian household holds 84% of its wealth in real estate, 11% in gold and the remaining 5% in financial assets.

Green shoots in rural belts help gold NBFCs grow | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Green shoots in rural belts help gold NBFCs grow October 31, 2017Economic TimesManappuram Share Despite scanty rains in south India, gold loan NBFCs like Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Fincorp, who have a major presence in the region, are expecting 10-20 per cent growth in their assets under management (AUM) as the rural economy is gradually recovering from demonetisation and other parts of the country, which have received good rains, are showing better gold loan offtake.Rising gold prices is also helping the NBFCs to attract borrowers and keep defaults under check. Gold prices have appreciated by 7 per cent since the beginning of the year and on Wednesday the price of gold was hovering around Rs 29,700 per 10 gm in the local market.VP Nandakumar, CEO, Manappuram Finance said "We are seeing indications of a pick-up in demand for gold loans but our reading is that this is more about the rural economy recovering from the impact of demonetisation. No doubt, a good monsoon will brighten pros pects, especially in south India which had been facing acute water scarcity." He added that the NBFC's Q1 performance was subdued mainly because the unorganised sector was still getting back on its feet after demonetisation and the drought-like conditions in large parts of south India had affected off-take of gold loan. "Our consolidated AUM stood at about Rs 13,400 crore and over the rest of the year, we are looking at a growth of 10 per cent," he said.Thomas George Muthoot, director, Muthoot Fincorp, said his company is aiming at a 20 per cent growth in AUM this fiscal. "Gold loan is showing good growth in north, west and eastern parts of the country," he said.

Manappuram Finance Ltd – Catering to demands at forefront of technology | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance Ltd – Catering to demands at forefront of technology August 21, 2017The Banking & Financial PostManappuram Share Manappuram Finance Ltd has long been at the forefront of technology in gold loans and it continues to invest in technology. The first corporate entity to get into gold loans, Manappuram is now expanding its profile catering to the diversified demands of its customers, says V.P. Nandakumar, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Manappuram Finance Ltd, in conversation with Rashi Aditi Ghosh of Elets News Network (ENN).Tell us about Manappuram Finance Ltd and its services in India.Manappuram Finance Ltd is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) incorporated in 1992 and predominantly engaged in gold loans the business of lending against used household gold jewellery.We were the first corporate entity to get into gold loans. Prior to our entry, this used to be the preserve of moneylenders and pawnbrokers operating in lanes and bylanes. As the first corporate to get into this business, we introduced scientific management practices to this hidebound business and pioneered the use of technology in gold loans. The most recent example of our tech focus is our “Online Gold Loans” (OGL) which we launched in September 2015. A customer who has completed the initial formalities can now avail a gold loan 24X7, from anywhere in the world, even if he is sitting at home. The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to his bank account.After nearly two decades of exclusive focus on gold loans, we have now diversified into promising new areas like microfinance, home finance, vehicle loans, SME lending, insurance broking etc. The entry into microfinance followed our acquisition (and turnaround) of the Chennai-based Asirvad Microfinance Pvt. Ltd. in 2015. Over the next few years, we hope to become a multi-product NBFC with a range of products from housing loans, vehicle finance, microfinance, SME loans etc. besides our core offering of gold loans.Today, new businesses contribute about 18 to 19 per cent of our total business. Over the next two to three years, that share is likely to go up to about 25 per cent, in line with our vision to become a multi-product NBFC.Technology interface is transforming banking, what measures have you taken to remain updated in this context?Manappuram has long been at the forefront of technology in gold loans and we continue to invest in technology. We are preparing for future challenges with innovative products with a focus on technological development. Given the rapid growth in online platforms, there’s no doubt that conventional ways of doing business through brick and mortar branches will become less important in future and we are prepared for that eventuality.In May this year, we launched a co-branded prepaid money card. The card can be pre-loaded up to a maximum amount of Rs 50,000 and then used to withdraw money from all ATMs . We are planning to issue the prepaid card to our customer base and link their existing gold loan accounts to the card.Along with the prepaid card, we have also launched our branded eWallet under the name “MaKash” which we hope to scale up in the coming months. We expect that the prepaid card and the eWallet will eventually help in making our Online Gold Loans a more compelling proposition for our customers. We are also working on an SGL, or SMS-based gold loan product, for customers who find it difficult to access the Internet . And, we are continuing with our long term work to develop a high tech IoT (internet of things) based network enabled keyless gold storage technologies that will significantly address the security aspect at the branch.To sum up, we recognise that technology will be a key differentiator in this business and we are determined to lead the way.India is progressing, so does its choices of investments, how do you maintain consumers’ interest in gold investment?Regarding gold as an investment option, it is true that there has been a substantial correction in price from the peak levels of 2011 and 2012. However, beginning from January 2016, gold prices have regained ground and generally held steady in the range of $ 1,200 to $ 1,300.Investment in gold and jewellery for the long-term is a safe option because the supply of physical gold continues to be meagre in relation to the demand. Therefore, while the price may fluctuate, there is protection on the downside. Recently, Gold bonds have emerged as a useful alternative to those who buy gold purely for investment purpose who now get to earn some interest on their investments though it may not interest those who buy gold jewellery for consumption. Digital payments is the new trend, how are you encouraging it?Post-demonetisation, we have entered an era where the role of cash is being systematically downgraded. We recognise that the future is increasingly cashless or “less cash” , and therefore, we have to think of ways to ease the transition for our customers by offering them a choice of convenient alternatives to cash. Even before the demonetisation announcement, a significant proportion of our total disbursements was made through NEFT payment or by cheque. We had set up alternative repayment channels like online repayments using net banking, debit cards and e-wallets and we have been encouraging our customers to make use of these channels.We have tie-ups with PAYTM, MPESA, M-RUPEE, ITZCASH and other new-age mobile wallet services to enhance our brand positioning, collection, lead generation, and customer experience.Read more Previous NewsGreen shoots in rural belts help gold NBFCs growNext NewsMr. V.P.

Gold is more a necessity than a luxury in India | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold is more a necessity than a luxury in India July 06, 2017LivemintManappuram Share Gold consumption in India is a universal phenomenon across income classes, which explains why the GST rate on gold was fixed at just 3% and not 18%In the run-up to the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, Arvind Subramanian, had argued that in line with other luxury items, gold should attract an 18% GST rate. However, bowing to opposition from states and industry bodies, the final rate levied on gold turned out to be much lower at 3%.A Mint analysis of household survey data seems to suggest that one reason why state governments may have lobbied for a low tax rate on gold is because in a country such as India, gold purchases are not an exclusive preserve of the rich. Even though the rich tend to buy more of it, possession of gold is a universal phenomenon across income classes, the Household Survey on India’s Citizen Environment & Consumer Economy (ICE 360° survey) shows.

But the growth momentum was interrupted with the demonetisation announcement and the consequent cash shortage affected our normal operations for a while. Since then, the cash situation has improved, but the sector is yet to get back to its feet. Therefore we may have to wait for some time for growth of gold loans to get back to earlier levels," said VP Nandakumar, CEO, Manappuram Finance. “A growth of 10%-15% is achievable assuming gold prices hold steady at current levels, and hopefully there are no major disruptions to the domestic and global economy, “he said.Pledging gold as collateral has been a regular feature of India's gold market.Link:http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/58355791.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst Previous News"Gold loan NBFCs demand parity with banks in more areas"Next NewsOn ET Now, Mr. V.P.

Online gold loans to get big boost: Manappuram Finance Ltd CEO & MD | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Online gold loans to get big boost: Manappuram Finance Ltd CEO & MD April 09, 2017Times of IndiaManappuram Share MD & CEO V P Nandakumar says the target for FY18 is to grow consolidated AUM by 20% Gold loan non-banking finance company (NBFC) Manappuram Finance Ltd, which has posted an assets under management (AUM) of Rs 14,600 crore by the end of the quarter ended December 2016, has recently said that its board has considered and approved the business plan for financial year 2017-18. The company is targeting a growth of 20 per cent in consolidated AUM during the current financial year. In an interaction with Gireesh Babu, V P NANDAKUMAR, managing director and CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd, elaborates on the company's plans and targets during the current financial year. Edited Excerpts: What has been the trend in the gold loan industry in the financial year 2016-17? What was the impact of demonetisation? The financial year began on a very positive note with growth in gold loans higher than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We were helped by the fact that gold prices held up very well for much of the year. However, the third quarter performance saw a deceleration in growth attributable to demonetisation and the dislocation caused by the shortage of currency. Today, demonetisation is behind us and we expect to get back on the growth path. What has been the impact of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) decision to restrict cash transactions to Rs 20,000? Indications that the government and the RBI are keen to reduce the role of cash in financial transactions have been there for some years now. Accordingly, the RBI has been taking proactive measures to speed up the pace of digitisation and we fully support it. Over the past two years, we have also been preparing ourselves for a cashless (or less-cash) environment. That is why, even before demonetisation, we had put in place alternative channels for payment of interest and principal, like net banking, debit cards and e-wallets, among others. On a broader level, the push towards a cashless economy is likely to set off a long-term trend of shift in business away from the informal and unorganised players and towards the organised sector. This will certainly help banks and NBFCs. In fact, NBFCs may stand to gain more as they have greater last-mile reach and better connect with the low-income groups. What is the business outlook for the financial year 2017-18? The business outlook for this financial year envisages growth in AUM for gold loans in the range of 15 to 20 per cent. Of course, the microfinance, home finance and commercial vehicles loans businesses are expected to grow much faster considering that their base is smaller. The target for growth in consolidated AUM is also in the 15 to 20 per cent range. How has your diversification into the non-gold business been doing? What is the outlook? The acquisition of Asirvad in February 2015 was a milestone for us. More importantly, having taken over the company, we also succeeded in turning it around. When we took over, the company had an AUM of less than Rs 300 crore. In little more than a year, the AUM had gone up three times. The Asirvad acquisition has helped us diversify our portfolio away from our exclusive focus on gold loans. Today, our vision is to emerge as a diversified, multi-product NBFC. Furthermore, non-gold businesses such as microfinance, home loans and commercial vehicle finance already contribute about 16 per cent of our total business, which we hope will increase to 25 per cent by the end of 2017-18. Currently, our gold loan business operates through more than 3,000 branches across India. Our view is that this gives us adequate reach into our target markets and, therefore, we are not contemplating further expansion of our branch network. Going forward, our larger focus will be to ensure that per-branch business levels pick up and to turn around the marginal branches. How is the online gold loan business doing? What are the future prospects for this business? Online gold loan is indeed a breakthrough in the sector and particularly apt as we head towards a cashless economy. We had launched our online gold loan (OGL) product in 2015 and it is designed to be totally cashless at our end. A customer has to come to our branch only once to deposit his gold and execute necessary documents. After that, he can avail a loan up to eligibility anytime from anywhere using a smart phone and the loan amount gets transferred to his bank account instantaneously. The OGL business has picked up well in recent days and it now accounts for more than 10 per cent of total gold loans. Our new television advertisement campaign promotes OGL in a big way and we hope this will contribute to higher volumes. There were reports that you are planning to sell some of your shares in the company. What is your response? We have already issued an official denial in respect of these reports. We stand by it.

Farming, travelling and some business for Manappuram Finance CEO | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Farming, travelling and some business for Manappuram Finance CEO April 02, 2017The New Indian ExpressManappuram Share Before walking briskly into his office every morning, V P Nandakumar, managing director and CEO of Manappuram Finance, would have walked at least six km—most of it through his farm at Valapad in Thrissur. Nandakumar says he is very particular about his morning walk.Probe him further and he reveals that it’s not the walk per se that matters but the quality time that he gets to spend at his farm. In fact, he says, he chalks out his plan for the day from the farm itself.“I am passionate about eco-farming, and I keep trying out new ideas in my own farm here at Valapad. I find it very relaxing to move around the farm and it also allows me time to gather my thoughts for the day and to do some deeper reflection,” he says.Even though his hectic schedule doesn’t allow him much time for reading, he manages to catch with most financial dailies. When work gets too hectic, he takes a break.“I take occasional break and go out with my extended family, children and grandchildren included. Last December, we were in South Africa and before that, during the Onam break, we went to France. South Africa was a great experience, especially the wild-life parks, very different from the usual tourist experience,” Nandakumar adds.His wife Sushama, a retired headmistress, is now the Managing Director of Manappuram Jewellers, which owns the Riti Jewelry chain of jewellery stores. He has three children. His eldest daughter Sumitha is a gynaecologist. His two sons-Sooraj and Suhas- have done their MBA from the UK. Now they are at senior positions in the company.His advice to wannabe entrepreneurs: “To build a successful business, think big and stay focused on the long term goal of building a world-class institution. Remember, short cuts don’t work here. Be transparent and don’t forget to recognise and reward your stakeholders.”Link:http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/apr/01/farming-travelling-and-some-business-for-manappuram-finance-ceo-1588760.html Previous NewsOnline gold loans to get big boost: Manappuram Finance Ltd CEO & MDNext News"Interventions to last a Lifetime" – Mr. V.

Interview with V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance Limited | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Interview with V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance Limited February 25, 2017India InfolineManappuram Share “The key challenge over the medium and long term is to maintain the pace of diversification of our portfolio, and transform ourselves from a gold loan NBFC to one with a well-diversified portfolio.”V.P. Nandakumar is the Managing Director & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd., a leading gold loan company that is ranked among India’s top 20 non-banking finance companies. Manappuram’s origins go back to 1949 when it was founded by the late V.C. Padmanabhan, father of Mr. Nandakumar. In those days its activity was money lending carried out on a modest scale at Valapad. Mr. Nandakumar took over the reins of this one branch business in 1986 after his father expired. Since then, it has been a story of unprecedented growth, and his leadership was instrumental in scripting the success story. Manappuram Finance Ltd. is one of India’s leading gold loan NBFCs. Promoted by Shri. V.P. Nandakumar, the current MD & CEO, its origins go back to 1949 when it was founded in the coastal village of Valapad (Thrissur District) by his late father Mr. V.C. Padmanabhan. The firm was involved in pawn broking and money lending carried out on a modest scale. Shri Nandakumar took over the reins in 1986 after his father expired.Since then, it has been a story of unparalleled growth with many milestones crossed. Incorporated in 1992, Manappuram Finance Ltd. has grown at a rapid pace. Today, it has 3,747 branches across 28 states/UTs with assets under management (AUM) of nearly Rs.13,0140 million and a workforce of 19,372. Replying to IIFL, V.P. Nandakumar said, “The key challenge over the medium and long term is to maintain the pace of diversification of our portfolio, and transform ourselves from a gold loan NBFC to one with a well diversified portfolio.” What are the key challenges that the company is currently facing? The short term challenge is to get back onto the growth track and regain momentum after the slowdown in the third quarter due to the dislocation caused by demonetisation. However, the situation is now almost back to normal and we expect a normal 4th quarter. The key challenge over the medium and long term is to maintain the pace of diversification of our portfolio, and transform ourselves from a gold loan NBFC to one with a well diversified portfolio. We have an ambitious target to increase the contribution of non-gold businesses to 25% of total business by 2018, and then, take it up to 50% levels, hopefully by 2020. At the moment, our non gold businesses contribute 15% to total business. How do you analyse the Union Budget 2017. Has the Union Budget fulfilled the industry expectations? I think it was a prudent budget that did well to avoid the populism route. The decision to keep fiscal deficit within the limits will be helpful for the industry as it will provide relief to RBI, should it decide to lower interest rate in the future. The announcement about granting infrastructure status to affordable housing is a major positive, as far as we are concerned. The recent move of demonetisation has caused an operational slowdown, what was its effect on the company? As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter performance saw a deceleration in growth that can be attributed to demonetisation and the dislocation caused by the shortage of currency. However, today the situation is almost back to normal and we expect the 4th quarter to revert back to growth. Since the company has diversified its portfolio towards non–gold business, what are the growth estimates in the current fiscal? Our non-gold loan business continued to gather momentum. The contribution of new businesses to the consolidated AUM of the company has increased to 15.7% compared to 14.5% in the previous quarter. We expect to maintain similar growth rate in the near future. What are the NPAs’ estimates in Q4FY17? NPA levels are expected to decline in the coming quarter as the economy regains footing, and as we go ahead with auctions that were kept pending in the third quarter. We had done this to allow some of our customers more time in the light of difficulties they faced in the aftermath of demonetisation. We expect NPA levels to come down to below 1% by the end of the 4th quarter. The Q3FY17 results have been excellent, what is the major reason for such a outstanding result? Our performance in Q3FY17 has indeed been very good compared to Q3 of FY16. We were supported by the fact that gold prices held up very well for most of the calendar year 2016, contrary to the many pessimistic forecasts at the beginning of the year. Also, the overall reduction in interest rates in the economy contributed to the performance, as we were able to keep a lid on borrowing costs.Read more Previous NewsManappuram Finance Limited signs up with Nucleus Software for cloud based lending solutionNext NewsManappuram Finance consolidated net doubles to Rs. 202 crore in Q3Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Centre must go full distance with cashless drive: Manappuram CEO | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Centre must go full distance with cashless drive: Manappuram CEO January 30, 2017The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share Says Budget should restore priority sector status for gold loans given by NBFCsHaving taken the trouble to demonetise higher denomination notes, the Centre should now think of going the full distance in moving India towards a cashless economy, according to VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO, Manappuram Finance, a leading gold loan company.Rather than adopt a top-down approach, it should devise an incentive mechanism that rewards cashless transactions, followed by some relatively mild disincentives on the use of cash, Nandakumar said in his views on what he expects from Budget 2017-18.Lower taxParticularly helpful would be a tax regime that levies a lower tax rate on cashless transactions. Once people see the prospect of monetary gain from going cashless, they will themselves seek out ways to get into cashless modes. Once positive incentives are in place, the government may then consider disincentives, such as a tax on cash withdrawal above a certain limit, which will then face less resistance.The idea of a permanent withdrawal of all convenience fees, service charges and surcharges levied by government agencies (like utility service providers and for various payments by consumers to government) is worth implementing, Nandakumar said.Tax on dividendsBudget 2016 had levied an additional 10 per cent tax on gross dividends in excess of ₹10 lakh per annum.This tax is in addition to the dividend distribution tax already paid by the company and amounts to taxing the same income twice, Nandakumar said.Further, if one considers that dividends are paid out of the post-tax profit of a company, this measure amounts to taxing the same income three times.“This is not fair and it unnecessarily penalises the risk-taking entrepreneurial class who would have ploughed their personal wealth and savings in their businesses. As it stands, it is nothing but a tax on entrepreneurship and, therefore, should be revoked.”Gold loansUntil 2011, gold loans given by NBFCs to eligible categories of borrowers (agriculture, MSME or micro-loans) were considered as priority sector, which allowed NBFCs to obtain refinance from banks on relatively better terms.The subsequent withdrawal of priority sector status has pushed up borrowing costs for these borrowers as banks lack last mile reach and have largely been unable to fill the gap, Nandakumar said.“Accordingly, we believe a restoration of status quo is needed,” he added.Link:http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/centre-must-go-full-distance-with-cashless-drive-manappuram-ceo/article9510105.ece Previous NewsMr. V.

Even in cash-drained economy, gold is most liquid asset, says Manappuram Finance chief | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Even in cash-drained economy, gold is most liquid asset, says Manappuram Finance chief December 08, 2016The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share The transition to a cashless society has to be carefully managed, says VP NandakumarThe perception that gold has lost the ‘most liquid asset’ status in a cash-drained economy is wrong, says VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO, Manappuram Finance, a leading gold-loan NBFC.Gold continues to be the most liquid asset for millions of ordinary Indians who buy it in relatively small quantities and for whom it is the preferred way to deploy their savings, he told BusinessLine.Not for the rich“Of course, it can be different for the rich who may have used it as a conduit for unaccounted wealth. This is not of concern to us because we deal largely with the bottom of the pyramid.” The ‘cash to cashless’ transition is taking place already in customer transactions at Manappuram. In fact, even before demonetisation, about 50 per cent of the total disbursements was made through NEFT payments or cheques.“We had set up alternative repayment channels like online repayments using Net banking, debit cards and e-wallets and we have encouraged customers to make use of these channels.”Last year, Manappuram had launched an online gold loan product, which is fully cashless at its end.A customer needs to come to a branch only once to deposit his gold and execute necessary documents.After that, he can take a loan up to his eligibility any time, from anywhere in the world using a smartphone, computer, or other Internet-enabled devices.The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to his bank account. Even after repayment, the gold will continue to remain with the Manappuram branch for future loans to be taken online.Nandakumar was of the view that demonetisation may curb demand and delay collections/repayments. But over the medium and long term, it will actually improve efficiency. Demonetisation has led to a sharp increase in low-cost deposits with banks and they have already begun to cut interest rates on deposits.This augurs well for the economy as the prospect of reduction in interest rate brightens. “This will benefit both banks and non-banks,” he said.Demonetisation has also boosted the supply of money in the formal economy. This will initiate a long-term trend of transfer of business from the unorganised to the organised (and tax-paying) sectors.The drive against black money is a measure whose long-term benefits are not in doubt. “The short-term pains, though inevitable to some extent, should be minimised to the extent possible.“While the vision of a cashless society is laudable, given that cash is widely used by micro and small enterprises, the transition has to be carefully managed.”Demonetisation may not lead to revision of loan-to-value, Nandakumar said. There is no such linkage between the two, he added.Relaxation of rules for classifying bad loans for small borrowers is not particularly relevant to gold-loan NBFCs since the loan is fully secured by ‘liquid’ collateral, he added.Link: http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/even-in-cashdrained-economy-gold-is-most-liquid-asset-says-manappuram-finance-chief/article9418364.ece Previous News"Interest rate slash to benefit us" – Mr. V.

Gold-loan NBFCs prefer epayments | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold-loan NBFCs prefer epayments November 28, 2016Economic TimesManappuram Share Gold-loan NBFCs, such as Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Fincorp, which have registered a 40-50% decline in business since demonetisation was announced on November 8, are now encouraging their customers to use net banking, debit cards and e-wallets for repayments.VP Nandakumar, managing director, Manappuram Finance, said: "There is no denying that demonetisation has caused a shortage of cash in the market. Some customers faced problems in making repayments because we stopped accepting old notes. We are encouraging them to pay using online tools. We started accepting repayments by cheque."However, Nandakumar said he is hopeful that demonetisation will eventually benefit gold-loan NBFCs the most because the cash crunch will lead to a shift in business from unorganised players to the organised ones."After demonetisation, banks are flushed with CASA (current account, savings account) funds, and they have already lowered deposit rates. It won't be long before lending rates also come down, and that will be another major positive gold-loan NBFCs," he said.The diminished role of cash in business will also lower operating expenses. Thomas George Muthoot, director, Muthoot Fincorp, said they were asking customers to remit money directly into their account."Just after demonetisation was announced, disbursal dropped by 60%. Now, it has improved and is currently hovering around 40-50%," he said. According to Nandakumar, demonetisation has affected only 50% of their business. "Even before demonetisation, about 50% of our total disbursements was through NEFT because as per rules, disbursements above Rs 1 lakh have to be made through a bank account.For loans of smaller amounts, where customers are keen to get it in cash, there has been an impact because of constrained supply of new notes. When supply eases, we expect things to get back to normal," the Manappuram chief said.Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Fincorp had earlier said the country's gold loan business, or lending against gold, could grow by 10-20% from last fiscal as a period of steady increase in gold price without excessive volatility portends well for the industry.

Manappuram Home Fin eyes Rs 3,000 cr asset size by 2020 | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Home Fin eyes Rs 3,000 cr asset size by 2020 November 14, 2016Financial ChronicleManappuram Share Having launched operations last year, Manappuram Home Finance has set a target to achieve an asset size of Rs 3,000 crore by 2020. It also hopes to breakeven by FY18. In the first full year of operations, the company clocked an AUM (asset under management) of Rs 220 crore. It is currently operating in six states – Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west and the four states in the south.“This year we hope to touch an AUM of Rs 450 crore. We will be getting into Madhya Pradesh and Rajastan and strengthening our presence in Andhra Pradesh and Telengana,’ said Aloke Ghasal, CEO, Manappuram Home Finance. “By 2020, we hope to clock Rs 3,000 crore asset size,’ he added.Despite having a clientele of 1,800, the company has not tried to fully leverage the customer base of its parent company, Manappuram Finance. “Among our customers, those acquired from Manappuram is very small. We have been choosy while reaching out to Manappuram customers. While the average ticket size of Manappuram Finance gold loan is lesser than Rs 70,000, we are looking at only customers who avail loans above Rs one lakh,” said Ghosal. However, the brand equity of the parent company is helping the company in getting customers.According to him, growing the business is not difficult for the company considering the needs of the target customer. In terms of interest rate, the company is positioned at the middle of the market. Home Finance companies offer home loan rates ranging from 11 per cent to 18 per cent.“The segment of customers we deal with are not very particular about pricing. They look for companies which are quick in assessing the loan eligibility and processing the loan faster. Pricing is secondary as they are more concerned about the equated monthly installment,’ he said.The company has approached National Housing Board for refinancing purposes. It has also received stable rating from Crisil.‘We will have a calibrated growth. While growing volumes our focus will also be on improving yields,’ he said.

CRISIL assigns stable rating for Manappuram Home Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! CRISIL assigns stable rating for Manappuram Home Finance October 26, 2016Business StandardManappuram Share Leading credit rating agency CRISIL has assigned its "A+/stable" credit rating to the long term bank loan facility of Manappuram Home Finance Private Ltd (MHF).The rating reflects managerial and financial support received from the parent Manappuram Finance Ltd. and adequate capitalization.According to CRISIL, Manappuram Home Finance is adequately capitalized for the expected scale of business following infusion of capital of Rs. 55 crore in fiscal 2016 taking its total paid up capital to Rs.100 crore.Additional infusions are expected to support capital adequacy and keep the gearing at around five times over the medium term. These rating strengths are partially offset by a small scale of operations with a limited track record, a modest earnings profile, and exposure to inherent risks relating to the affordable housing finance segment.The expectation of support from the parent is driven by the strategic importance of the company to the Manappuram group in diversification of its financial product suite.The business is scalable and is expected to grow materially over the medium term. Manappuram Finance Ltd. holds 100 percent of the equity in Manappuram Home Finance.The parent has infused growth capital and will infuse additional capital as and when required. Furthermore, its Managing Director, VP Nandakumar, along with another director, is represented on the board of the company.CRISIL believes Manappuram Home Finance will continue to receive strong financial and managerial support from its parent, while maintaining adequate capitalization, over the medium term.Link: http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/crisil-assigns-stable-rating-for-manappuram-home-finance-116102600442_1.html Previous NewsManappuram Finance profit jumps three-fold in Q2Next NewsManappuram Finance tops BSE 500 chart with two-fold return this yearPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

We have not faced the ALM issues: Senthil Kumar, Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! We have not faced the ALM issues: Senthil Kumar, Manappuram Finance December 19, 2018Business StandardManappuram Share Higher borrowing costs detrimental to retail lending: Senthil Kumar, Manappuram FinanceSenthil Kumar, Executive Vice President at Manappuram Finance tells Advait Rao Palepu that despite borrowing costs rising, the company has not faced the asset-liability management (ALM) issues that other non-bank financiers faced in recent months. However, he says if financiers face higher borrowing costs in the coming months it would be detrimental for retail lending and consumption.Has the present liquidity and ALM situation affected Mannapuram Finance?Well, I understand that our cost of funds has gone up a bit over the last one year. However, we do not face any pressure on the ALM side. A large part of our consolidated AuM — in fact nearly 75 percent — is parked in short term gold loans where the average loan gets repaid in about 60 days. Another 15 per cent is accounted for by microfinance (MFI) loans which are also quite short term. The Small-Medium-Enterprises (SME) book was under pressure on account of the twin disruptions of demonetization and GST. These pressures are now easing but the overall cash flows are still somewhat strained although it is heading to normalcy. Therefore, we just do not face the ALM issues that other NBFCs may be facing.Read more Previous NewsAsirvad Microfinance securitises MF portfolioNext NewsManappuram: Trust Etched in GoldPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

We want to aggressively grow home loan portfolio: VP Nandakumar, Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! We want to aggressively grow home loan portfolio: VP Nandakumar, Manappuram Finance April 21, 2017Economic TimesManappuram Share In a chat with ET Now, VP Nandakumar, Manappuram Finance says that the company plan to have 50% revenue from gold loan and 50% from non gold segment by 2025.Your stock has been on a fire of late, a significant traction in the stock price, tell us a little bit more about how you have managed to successfully diversify the business offerings to CVs, MFIs, etc and what really is the business plan going forward for these segments?We have been a premier player in the gold loan segment for the last one decade and we have been maintaining that and growing that, last year also we have grown our gold loan book well. Due to demonetisation there was some impact on the disbursals as such because historically and conventionally this is a cash business, full cash business. Now we are slowly moving to a cashless mode also through our online gold loan digital gold loan product. Because of demonetisation the currencies were not available at the branches which impacted the disbursals, it has gone down to 40% and now it has come back to around 95%. I hope by next month the gold loan disbursal will reach the 100% which was of the same level of pre demonetisation era. Gold loan is growing and it has a potential for growth also but at the same time we do not want to concentrate on a single product because single product as the regulator see it as we also see it single product has its own risks so we thought of diversifying. We have identified certain areas; one area is microfinance, we are acquired more than 90% of Asirwad Microfinance which is a Chennai based company and after our acquisition this company is also spatially distributed across the country and grown and that company is doing well. Post demonetisation there are some impact in some collections, in some places in the microfinance industry but luckily in most of these places our presence is meagre but for Karnataka we have some presence in Bangalore but our recovery is improving steadily improving. The overall recovery rate has crossed 92% and month on month our collections are improving. There will be some at the same time there will be some impact on the NPA level in places like Bangalore which we will fully write off during this-- plans to write off during this quarter-- the last quarter. So the other businesses, which we are in is home finance which is doing well. The other portfolio is the commercial vehicles segment. Luckily on these areas there is not much impact of demonetisation. We are all with demonetisation and everything, we are hopeful that we will maintain our profitability plans, growth plans this year also. How much of your current business you would classify is coming from the non gold segment now?The total is around 15% is coming from non gold segment. We want to do that. By 2025 at least we plan to have 50:50, 50 from gold loan and 50 from non gold segment. We want to aggressively grow this home loan portfolio. Our primary thrust is affordable housing finance which we are expanding. The other which we want to grow is the commercial vehicle finance area. We are planning to do the business in the south as well as west to begin with and thereafter we will expand to other areas. Microfinance also we are distributing across the country, one risk is the political risk and the other risk-- sometimes what happens in some areas because of drought or other natural calamities the collection can be impacted. We plan to mitigate that risk also.There were recent media reports stating that promoters are looking to sell some stake in Mannapuram, is there any truth to that?It is a false news.With your existing book, the existing cash level can you do this kind of a migration or you will have to dilute a lot?No, we can do that because see we are better capitalised. Our tier-1 capital itself is over 20% whereas the statutory requirement is 12% so we are very well above that, that capital can be used for other businesses also. Gold loan, the prospects of growth of around 20% can be maintained even after allocating the capital for other businesses which will protect our ROE always at a level of above 20%. What I am targeting is an ROE is 20%. So there is no need of any dilution, we have adequate capital to ensure a robust growth in areas like home finance, SME finance, then again vehicle finance and microfinance.Link:http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/58292618.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst Previous NewsIf rates are steady, gold loan NBFCs may see 28% growthNext NewsManappuram Finance launches co-branded prepaid Money CardPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Our aim is to cater to our customers through providing micro credit at lowest possible rates while maintaining healthy growth of the company,” S.V. Raja Vaidyanathan, Founder Chairman and Managing Director, Asirvad Micro Finance Private Ltd. said."The lending rate cut by Asirvad Microfinace is a welcome move. Microfinance is today seen as a responsible sector and with NPAs less than 1% funding in the sector has improved from earlier. In an industry like microfinance, interest rates assume a greater significance as clients are from the low income households. The industry collectively is striving to make the clients its focus which is evident from the rate cuts by other microfinance companies too in the recent past,” Ratna Vishwanathan, CEO, Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) said. Asirvad Microfinance has recently been given ‘A+’ rating by credit agency, Crisil which is the highest rating given by the agency to any microfinance company. This is a positive sign for the industry as the rating agencies have started acknowledging microfinance sector as a robust and stable sector. This will also lead to better flow of funds for the sector from banks and other institutions at lower rates. Headquartered at Chennai, Asirvad Microfinance Ltd started operations from 2007 and is a part of Mannapuram Finance Ltd. The company aspires to develop and make use of innovative technology to deliver its services and enrich the community at large.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Asirvad Microfinance eyes loan book of Rs 2,700 cr by March '18 October 01, 2016Deccan HeraldManappuram Share Non-banking finance company microfinance institution (NBFC-MFI) Asirvad, which is a majority owned subsidiary of Manappuram Finance, aims to achieve a portfolio size of about Rs 2,400-2,700 crore by March 2018. As on August 31, 2016, Asirvad had an AUM of Rs 1,465 crore and a network of 504 branches in 133 districts in 13 states.Talking to DH, Asirvad Microfinance MD and CEO S V Raja Vaidhyanathan said, “As a strategy, we propose to expand our operations to all states in India. We have at present 500 branches spread across the country. We have launched our operations recently in West Bengal and Rajasthan and we will be launching in Odisha and Maharashtra shortly. The northern market is expected to grow substantially in the days to come. Our target for this FY is Rs 2,000 crore, and we will be achieving the same.”Asirvad proposes to maintain the same level of growth during the next year as most of the branches opened in North India would be catering to more customers. “Achieving AUM of close to Rs 3,000 crore is not difficult. The year-on-year growth for the last year has been exceptional since we had the equity infusion from Manappuram which helped us in our growth. We have grown from Rs 330 crore as on March 31, 2015, to Rs 998 crore as of March 31, 2016.

Manappuram Finance is de-risking gold business from price fluctuation: CEO | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance is de-risking gold business from price fluctuation: CEO September 28, 2016The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share V.P.Nandakumar says the company’s cost of borrowing will fall below 10% in another quarterFalling gold prices and bond yields are posing new challenges for gold financiers. Speaking to BTVi , Manappuram Finance CEO and Managing Director VP Nandakumar says the company’s cost of borrowing will fall below 10 per cent in another quarter and help in improving the net interest margin by 20 bps. Manappuram is trying to de-link the gold finance business from the price vulnerability, to whatever extent possible, he said. Excerpts:The 10-year corporate-bond yields have fallen sharply. How much has your cost of borrowing come down in Q1?During the last one year, it has come down by almost 100 basis points. It is slightly over 10-10.1 per cent. In another quarter, it will definitely come down below 10 per cent.With the fall in cost of funds, what has been the impact on net interest margin (NIM)? Has the interest spreads increased?In the last two quarters, the change will be 20 bps. That benefit will show up in the NIM.Can you explain how the fall in yields gets translated in higher NIMs since financing is a competitive business?In the gold loan business, the lending rate remains more or less at 20-23 per cent. We also get that benefit in other businesses such as micro-finance. Recently, CRISIL and ICRA upgraded of our group companies. The micro-finance company also got a higher rating of A+ from CRISIL, for medium to long term. That is the case with home finance company, too. In micro-finance, as there is a NIM gap, the changes in interest rates will not affect the bottom-line. Also, the interest rate is not a critical factor in micro-finance.But in home finance and passenger-vehicle finance, we are reducing the interest rate commensurate with the rate trajectory, and passing on the benefits. As these two are a small part of our portfolio, the impact of rate reduction has been neutral.You have also been focussing on de-risking the gold loan business from gold price fluctuations. What’s the update on that? Will any move towards tighter lending norms have an impact on Manappuram?We are trying to de-link our gold finance business from the price vulnerability, to whatever extent possible. Our average loan-to-value (LTV) is at 69 per cent; we want to maintain that level or below that. Another factor to contain this price vulnerability is regular interest collection.The accrued interest a year ago was nearly 3 per cent, but two years ago, it was 8 per cent. Now the accrued interest has been brought down to 3 per cent. Our yield is about 24 per cent. So we have achieved good interest collection. Another thing is, we have introduced a short-term three-month product, in which the customer has to replace the ornaments every three months by paying interest up to date. This way, we address the price volatility.Turning to your diversification strategy, can you give us an update on the growth across all segments?Some of the businesses are on a string-growth path. Micro-finance is growing as per plans — the asset under management (AUM) is now at Rs. 1,500 crore. The passenger-vehicle business and housing finance may report an AUM of Rs. 2,200 crore. We have some Rs. 100 crore in other portfolio — Rs. 50 crore each for corporate and SME lending. All these segments are growing as budgeted.You have also launched an online gold card product and a credit card product. What has been the response?That portfolio is now at Rs. 700 crore, which is not that big; but having started six months ago, I feel there is a good traction in that. The technology is still being refined to ensure that we operate through a branch-less model. We don’t intend to close down the existing branches. We have 3,200 branches. But we will be able to do three times the business than the branch network because one can get loans 24x7 without coming to the branches.Link:http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-news/manappuram-finance-is-derisking-gold-business-from-price-fluctuation-ceo/article9155434.ece Previous NewsAsirvad Microfinance eyes loan book of Rs 2,700 cr by March '18Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Asirvad targets to grow micro loan book to Rs. 3,000 Cr | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Asirvad targets to grow micro loan book to Rs. 3,000 Cr November 28, 2022Financial ChronicleManappuram Share ASIRVAD Microfinance has set a target to grow its loan book to Rs 3,000 crore by March 2018. With no paucity of funds, the company has been multiplying its portfolio following its acquisition by Manappuram Finance in February 2015.In the last 18 months, Asirvad has grown its portfolio from Rs 310 crore to Rs 1,500 crore, while the number of borrowers has gone up from over three lakh to nine lakh; the number of branches has increased from 140 to 510.“The promoters and the investor Lok Capital were not able to infuse fresh funds into the company. Hence, we faced constraints in achieving further growth. Manappuram bought 85 per cent of the equity and has so far invested Rs 210 crore in the company. Of this, Rs 45 crore went to the investor as secondary sale of the equity, while the company got the remaining Rs 165 crore. Leveraging this amount by around six times, we brought in finance of another Rs 900 crore into the business,” said SV Raja Vaidhyanathan, MD and CEO, Asirvad Microfinance.At present, banks account for 50 per cent of the finance, followed by NBFCs (30 per cent) and securitisation (20 per cent). As the eight large MFIs are set to exit the business after becoming differentiated banks, bank finance under priority lending rates will be available for players like Asirvad. “The credit rating of the company also has gone up — from BBB+ to A+ — since Manappuram came in. This has helped us in getting bank finance. We hope bank finance to go up to 75 per cent,” he said.The company has also been expanding its presence to become a pan-India player. It currently operates in 12 states and aims to add three more states to the list by the year-end. However, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala account for close to Rs 1,000 crore of the company portfolio.The firms says efforts are on to operate in full capacity in the north-Indian branches, and hopes that the contribution of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka comes down to 40 per cent by March 2018.Manappuram will be further infusing Rs 100 crore as tier I capital by the next June quarter. Asirvad will also be issuing non-convertible debentures of Rs 75 crore by December this year.“With Manappuram’s backing, there will not any paucity of funds and this will help us scale faster,” added Vaidyanathan.

CRISIL assigns A+/Stable rating for Asirvad Microfinance Ltd | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! CRISIL assigns A+/Stable rating for Asirvad Microfinance Ltd September 20, 2016India InfolineManappuram Share The rating reflects the management and financial support that Asirvad derives from its parent Manappuram Finance Ltd (Manappuram Finance; rated 'CRISIL AA-/Stable/CRISIL A1+'). The rating also factors in adequate capitalisation and healthy profitability.Leading credit rating agency, CRISIL has assigned its “A+/Stable” credit rating for Asirvad Microfinance Ltd, said to be the highest current rating given by CRISIL to a microfinance company. The revised rating is applicable to the long-term bank facility and non-convertible debentures of the company. CRISIL has also assigned its 'CRISIL A1+' rating to the commercial paper programme of Asirvad. The rating reflects the management and financial support that Asirvad derives from its parent Manappuram Finance Ltd (Manappuram Finance; rated 'CRISIL AA-/Stable/CRISIL A1+'). The rating also factors in adequate capitalisation and healthy profitability. These rating strengths are partially offset by risks relating to geographical concentration and rapid growth in portfolio, and risks arising from potential regulatory and legislative changes in the microfinance sector. According to Crisil, Asirvad is adequately capitalised for its expected scale of business. Net worth and gearing (including securitisation as part of debt) were Rs 2.3 billion and 3.9 times as on March 31, 2016. The networth has increased from Rs 1.1 billion a year earlier, backed primarily by infusion of capital of around Rs 1 billion by Manappuram Finance during the year, in addition to higher accrual. Additional infusions of equity are expected to support capital adequacy over the medium term. The gearing, adjusted for off-balance sheet portfolio, should remain around 6 times. Profitability is expected to remain healthy, underpinned by ramp-up in scale of operations and fee-based income. The rating on Asirvad's debt centrally factors in expectation of support from the parent. The microfinance business is strategically important to the Manappuram group, and is its largest business after gold loans. The business is scalable, and has been profitable and, therefore, should be a key growth driver for the group over the medium term. Manappuram Finance holds 90% of the equity in Asirvad; has infused growth capital and will infuse capital as and when required. In addition, V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, and two other directors of Manappuram Finance are on the board of Asirvad. Given Manappuram Finance's strong moral obligation to support Asirvad, the parent's financial and managerial support are expected to continue over the medium term.

Manappuram plans to buy Fintech co, enter SME space | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram plans to buy Fintech co, enter SME space August 30, 2016DNA IndiaSumit Moitra Share Kerala firm is trying to reduce dependence on key business of loans against goldManappuram Finance, one of the largest gold loan companies, is on the acquisition prowl again. This time, it is looking for fintech companies, particularly those in the lending space.Kerala-based Manappuram is now trying to reduce its dependence on its key business of loans against gold and had earlier acquired a micro-finance company and a housing finance outfit in 2014 to diversify its business.“We are keen to acquire a fintech company by acquiring majority stake in a company that provides loans. This would help us to get into new-age technology-based lending. We are interested in looking at existing companies having good RoE (Return on Equity). Few proposals have been received and are being evaluated,” V P Nandakumar, managing director and CEO, told dna.The gold loan business, which by FY17 would continue to contribute 85% of Manappuram’s revenues, is also getting transformed, for which it needs a strong technology base, he said.Fintech companies like LoanTap or Deal4loans are NBFCs providing loans from their own funds while there are some acting as aggregators.“Entry into non-collateralised lending would be assisted through better data gathering, their accurate analysis on a timely basis which can happen only if we have a strong technology base,” Manappuram’s founder Nandakumar said on the sidelines of Indian Chamber of Commerce Banking Summit.Nandakumar has been trying to convert a legacy business to a new-age financial services provider and has already prepared its own in-house fintech capabilities. But to exploit available technologies to its fullest, Manappuram needs to have a dedicated fintech outfit, which, in the long term, would help the current gold loan provider become a full-fledged digital bank of the future.“Our in-house team has developed an app which can be used to avail instant loans against gold anytime of the day,” he said.Manappuram head believes technology would be increasingly playing a crucial role in banking and lending activities. Many of the new-generation banks for which licences are being given out by the Reserve Bank of India would be heavily dependent upon technology platforms.Manappuram also sees opportunities in the SME lending space and exploring the opportunity in investing in such NBFCs.“We were earlier insisting on having a majority stake in such lenders which turned out to be difficult as promoters weren’t willing to give away control. We are now planning to invest and pick up stake in these companies,” Nandakumar said.http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-manappuram-may-acquire-fintech-co-enter-sme-lending-2250126 Previous NewsCRISIL assigns A+/Stable rating for Asirvad Microfinance LtdNext NewsGold prices will hold firm with upward bias for remainder of year: Manappuram Finance’s NandakumarPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Gold prices will hold firm with upward bias for remainder of year: Manappuram Finance’s Nandakumar | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold prices will hold firm with upward bias for remainder of year: Manappuram Finance’s Nandakumar August 23, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share V P Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance says gold prices in India moves largely in tandem with international prices (after adjusting for the exchange rate).Gold has been one of the best asset classes of 2016 and has returned nearly 27 per cent since the beginning of the year. The yellow metal which started the year at around Rs 25,000 for 10 grams closed at Rs 31,610 on August 22 as per Indian Bullion and Jewellers’ Association data.Global uncertainty post-Brexit (Britain’s exit from the European Union) in late June 2016 help keep gold prices firm. In the domestic market, there are hopes that the coming festive season, followed by the marriage season will add strength to the precious metal.FeMoney spoke to V P Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance Limited, who are one of the largest gold loan provider to understand his views on the where gold could be headed.Q. What do you think would the impact of coming festive season on gold prices? Do you see it will remain firm over the next few months?A. We have to keep in mind that the gold prices in India moves largely in tandem with international prices (after adjusting for the exchange rate).In the international markets, the demand for and supply of physical gold is only of the factors that influence the price. In times of uncertainty, it is the demand for gold as investment that drives prices. We see this now in the way gold prices have rebounded since the beginning of the year mainly because of the poor state of the world economy and the uncertainty about US Federal Reserve being able to normalise interest rates any time soon.A. Coming to India, no doubt the festive season will see an uptick in demand but to expect that to have an impact on international gold price would be unrealistic. What can happen is that the recent trend of discount in gold price in the Indian market (compared to international prices) may come down or disappear. As you may know, the discount has come about in recent months because demand for gold jewellery has dropped after the recent sharp increases in gold price.Q. Do you think 7th Pay Commission payout will also help gold buying?A. Yes, a part of the payout can reasonably be expected to find its way to gold.Q. What is your year-end target for gold?A. As a matter of policy, we don’t give out targets for gold price. However, I personally believe that gold prices will hold firm with a marked upward bias over the remainder of the year.Q. What are the other domestic and overseas factors that could impact gold prices?A. In the short term, with the rise in investment demand for gold, domestic factors may not impact gold prices in any significant way.Among the overseas factors, I would certainly keep an eye on the US Fed. In fact, their inability to push through their stated intention to increase interest rates has been a great source of support for gold price. The other factors to watch out for would be how Europe fares in the aftermath of Brexit and in the longer term, how China manages the shift away from growth led by exports to one led by domestic consumption.Link: http://www.financialexpress.com/markets/commodities/gold-prices-will-hold-firm-with-upward-bias-for-remainder-of-year-manappuram-finances-nandakumar/354823/ Previous NewsManappuram plans to buy Fintech co, enter SME spaceNext NewsGold can rise higher on buying by risk-averse investorsPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Gold can rise higher on buying by risk-averse investors | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Gold can rise higher on buying by risk-averse investors August 17, 2016ManappuramV. P. Nandakumar Share Investment in gold has long been held as the best option for risk-averse investors in uncertain times.Since Brexit in June 2016, stock markets have rebounded after governments and central banks indicated they were ready to do “whatever it takes” to prevent slippages in their economies. The Bank of England has now cut interest rates to a historic low of 0.25 percent accompanied by a £170 billion package of stimulus measures. Earlier, the Japanese government had announced a fiscal stimulus said to be worth $276 billion. All this in a world already awash in fiscal and monetary stimulus money, with the US alone estimated to have pumped in $7.66 trillion between 2008 and 2012. Injection of newly minted money is likely only to extend the lull before the next big storm. Good times, we know, don’t last forever. But, whether artificially propping up the economy with liquidity will hold back bad times forever, remains uncertain.There is, however, one asset class about which there is no uncertainty and that is gold. Investment in gold has long been held as the best option for risk-averse investors in uncertain times. It was proved again as gold jumped nearly 5 percent (to $1,315) on the day of the Brexit verdict. In fact, even before the vote, gold had already posted gains of 20 percent during the year given the continuing growth woes in the developed world and with China faltering too. Since 1974, gold has not had a better first half of the year. However, despite the gains so far, the key takeaway today is that more appreciation is on the way.Outlook for gold priceGold price is, by and large, inversely related to interest rate being non-interest bearing. Any rise in uncertainty in the global market, and risk-averse investors pull out money from risky assets to park in safe haven investments like dollar denominated bonds and gold. Similarly, falling interest rates nudge gold price higher as the opportunity cost of holding the asset falls.The slow pace of recovery after the 2008 meltdown has compelled central banks across the globe to maintain low, even negative, interest rates to stimulate growth or to shore up whatever little of momentum there is. This easy money stance with interest rates held artificially low increases risk appetite. A significant chunk of this money then gets diverted to emerging markets in quest of higher returns pushing up stock indices in these parts while the lack of positive returns from bonds makes gold more attractive to hold.The latest data from the World Gold Council shows record investment in gold in the first half of 2016 with investors buying 1,064 tonnes during the first six months of 2016, 16 percent more than in the first half of 2009 when the financial crisis was most acute. Investment, rather than jewellery, was the largest component of gold demand for two consecutive quarters, which has not happened before. Individual investors, recoiling from historically low interest rates on bank deposits, have also been buying up gold bars and coins. Demand for the US Gold Eagle coins has jumped 84 percent this year.Not surprisingly then, Bank of America analysts in July raised the target on gold to $1,475 noting, “the world has been walking from crisis to crisis and we see risks that this may not change.” Analysts with Credit Suisse have suggested that $1,500 an ounce mark could be tested by the end of the year in view of the prolonged macroeconomic uncertainty while UBS says gold “is more compelling than ever” today because of low and negative interest rates and global geopolitical risks.After experimenting with artificially low interest rates, the trend towards negative interest rates on sovereign bonds is proving to be another support for gold. The conventional argument against investing in gold is that the metal generates no income while investment in bonds and shares fetches interest and dividends which offset the risk of fall in capital values. In contrast, when you invest in gold, you are effectively betting only on favourable price movements.However, with negative interest rates increasingly becoming the norm in the advanced economies, holding on to cash and gold becomes a sensible option. According to a recent report in Financial Times, about $13.4 trillion of sovereign bonds, primarily European and Japanese, are trading with negative yields. For many central banks these days, it’s a race to the bottom and beyond. What’s more, an increasing number of highly rated corporate bonds are also starting to get into the negative yield act. The case for gold has just become stronger.Of course, if there is a dark cloud somewhere, it is that the most recent uptick has been driven strongly by ETFs getting back in to the market. The risk is that demand will fade once there are signs of an economic recovery. And that should be flagged as the potential threat to gold price going forward.(The author is MD & CEO of Manappuram Finance Ltd. and Chairman of CII, Kerala State Council) Link: http://www.financialexpress.com/markets/commodities/gold-can-rise-higher-on-buying-by-risk-averse-investors/349543/ Previous NewsGold prices will hold firm with upward bias for remainder of year: Manappuram Finance’s NandakumarNext NewsManappuram Strategy ShiftPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Manappuram Strategy Shift | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Strategy Shift August 14, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share Gold loan provider Manappuram Finance is looking to ramp up its non-gold portfolio even as it looks to strengthen its core business through short-term products.The Kerala-based non-banking finance company (NBFC) - which has diversified into microfinance, affordable housing for mid- and low-income groups and commercial vehicle loans - expects these non-gold businesses to contribute around 25 per cent to its assets under management (AUM), or loans outstanding, in three years.The company has now set its eyes firmly on the universal banking licence.Nandakumar: New road mapWhile it is keen on a banking licence, the proposal has not yet been discussed with the board, V.P. Nandakumar, managing director and CEO of Manappuram Finance, told The Telegraph.The plan may come up for discussion after a road map has been prepared for the next three to five years. An external consultancy may be brought in to prepare this road map.Earlier this month, the RBI had announced final guidelines for on-tap licensing of universal banks.Existing NBFCs, which are controlled by resident Indians and have a successful track record of at least 10 years, are eligible to apply.The company's non-gold business accounts for about 12 per cent of its assets. It is planning to leverage its strong retail customer base, an expanding network and brand equity to grow its new businesses.In February 2015, Manappuram had acquired an 85 per cent stake in Asirvad Microfinance Pvt Ltd, one of the leading microfinance institutions in Tamil Nadu.The loan portfolio has increased to over Rs 1,200 crore as on June 30 from Rs 300 crore at the time of acquisition. By the end of this fiscal, the size of this portfolio is expected to exceed Rs 2,000 crore.Asirvad, which had its operations mostly in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, has now expanded to at least 13 states, including Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Another 100 branches are expected to be added this year, taking the total number to over 550.In the core gold loan business, the decision to shift to short-term loan products (three, six and nine months) against 12 months earlier has paid off. This business has disbursed loans over Rs 13,755 crore during the April-June quarter.

Meet the first 200-bagger of 2016, which almost doubled profits in June quarter | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Meet the first 200-bagger of 2016, which almost doubled profits in June quarter August 10, 2016Economic TimesManappuram Share It has been part of the most bullish trades on Dalal Street and there has been no let off.The Thrissur-based Manappuram Finance, a non-banking finance company, is the year's first and only 200-bagger so far with returns of 200.69 per cent through August 9.The NBFC space has been winner this year, as investors ditched ailing banks to seek profits in the best big bets on Dalal Street."The rally has got a lot to do with the fundamental outlook turning for the better, and that has got to do with many of these NBFCs being consumer-centric. All of them would actually start seeing better traction in terms of credit growth going ahead," Mahantesh Sabarad, Deputy HoR, SBI Cap Securities, told ETNow.As investors turned bullish on the space at the turn of the year, shares of Manappuram Finance have risen sharply, making investors a lot of money."The stock has had a fairly good runup over the past few months. Those who have bought it at lower levels have made good money on the stock," said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.The company has managed to provide stellar growth quarter after quarter as it moved from being just a gold finance company to a microfinance company.During the quarter ending June 2016, Manappuram Finance reported a 170 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 160.40 crore with asset under management swelling 28.8 per cent to Rs 13,014 crore."Asirvad, their microfinance arm, has got a microfinance loan book of Rs 1,000 crore and that is a high return on asset (ROA) business. Going forward, we estimate 3.6 per cent RoA for Manappuram Finance as a whole," said Dharmesh Kant, VP-Head Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Securities.That said, the company still remains heavily concentrated on the bullion business which, for Deven Choksey, is a point of concern."Manappuram has diversified further and started getting into other segments. However, a large part of the portfolio still stays in the bullion business, which is not giving me much comfort," he said.For Mahantesh Sabarad, the good days for NBFCs like Manappuram Finance are far from over, as they stand to benefit from further rate cut, which may aid their fight to win away retail consumers from ailing PSU banks."A fall in interest rates will support their ability to compete with the PSU banks and that is good news," he said.According to Deven Choksey, Manappuram may not fully benefit from that bullish sentiment in the space as the stock may be bracing for a huge correction."We believe some profit booking can be done on the stock and one may re-enter the counter at a lower level if the time or the opportunity permits," he said.Link: http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/meet-the-first-200-bagger-of-2016-which-almost-doubled-profits-in-june-quarter/articleshow/53628360.cms Previous NewsManappuram Strategy ShiftNext NewsManappuram net zooms 170%Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

On-tap banking may not see long queue for licence | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! On-tap banking may not see long queue for licence August 03, 2016Business StandardNupur Anand & Anup Roy Share The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has opened the doors for new players to enter the banking system. However, experts believe at least in the short to medium term, there isn’t going to a big queue of players at the regulator’s door seeking universal banking licence.Banking analysts believe the pool of players that were likely to apply has been streamlined by excluding corporate entities. Moreover, stringent regulatory framework applicable to a bank such as meeting priority-sector lending norms, focus on financial inclusion and statutory requirements are also going to serve as deterrent.“Priority sector requirement is a big challenge and we need more preparations to convince our investors before we take up the responsibility of meeting priority sector commitment. There would be a concession period but we need to figure out how we would be performing in that period, so that we can give adequate return to our investors,” said V P Nandakumar, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Manappuram Finance. The non-anking financial company (NBFC) is looking at applying in the next three or four years.Even though some large NBFCs will be interested, not all of them will rush to apply. “We don’t see many NBFCs converting into banks, given the stringent guidelines and statutory norms. Thus, though on-tap, licensing will be limited,” said a research report by Religare.Some other large NBFCs such as Bajaj Finserv and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services are going to get excluded because they are part of larger corporates and, as a result, do not fit the bill.Abizer Diwanji, national leader (financial services) at EY India, explained that considering that the gestation period of the business is long, players will take their time out and chalk out the plan and apply only after that. LICENCES ON TAPResident individuals having 10 years of experience in banking and finance at a senior level can apply for licenceCorporate entities to be excluded but they can hold 10% stake in a bankNBFCs converting into banks should do so through a holding company structureMinimum capital requirement is Rs 500 croreExperts say there would be no rush to apply for licenceGives scope to companies for long-term planning before applying for licenceMeeting priority-sector lending to be a daunting task for new banksBig cooperative banks best suited to become universal banks“It takes at least two-three years to have the start of a stable deposit base. But, as soon as an entity becomes a bank, the priority-sector obligation starts getting counted and that itself can make the bank a loss-making proposition. If you don’t have a particular scale, meeting priority-sector challenges can be quite daunting and NBFCs need to do serious research,” he added.The central bank has clearly stated that financial inclusion has to be one of the key objectives. Experts say considering there are 10 small finance banks (SFBs) and at least eight payments banks players that will also be focused on this space, competition is going to be significant. Profitability challenges for any of these new players will increase further.Banking experts believe the latest guidelines are also mainly directed towards individual professionals, who have relevant experience to start banking operations in India. Says Ashvin Parekh of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services: “I believe the guidelines are favourable towards professionals, who will bring in good global practices and new ideas into the sector.”While the guidelines say the key executives or promoters have to be ‘Indian residents’, experts say it will not be much of a hindrance because people like ex-Citibank chief Vikram Pandit or Anshu Jain (former co-CEO of Deutsche Bank) would most likely be in non-executive roles as chairperson. In fact, sources suggest some Indian bankers with foreign experience are already in talks with top legal brains in the banking sector to structure such deals.

Manappuram Finance looks to acquire microfinance companies in North and East | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance looks to acquire microfinance companies in North and East August 09, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share South-based gold loan provider Manappuram FinanceBSE -4.38 % is on the prowl for acquisition of microfinance companies as it looks to grow its share of non-gold loans, riding on the sector's success story.Manappuram said it is currently in talks with a few entities in the north and east, but is yet to zero in on its preferred candidates."We want to acquire MFIs in the north and east," Manappuram finance managing director VP Nandakumar told ET over the telephone.The acquisitions will help Manappuram reduce its share of gold loans, which account for 88 per cent of the consolidated portfolio, and raise priority sector loan books even as it keeps its eyes firmly on universal banking licence.Its total assets under management stood at Rs 11,433 crore at the end of March, according to a recent presentation to investors.Reserve Bank of India has put up bank licences on-tap, and said that new banks should maintain 40 per cent priority sector target from the beginning. Gold loans does not come under priority sector."At first, we would like to come as an investor or promoter. And eventually, these entities can be merged with Asirvad Microfinance to create a bigger one," the chief promoter of Manappuram said."We are looking at MFIs outside south India to eliminate geographic concentration and the risks associated with it. The risk in MFI business is mainly political," he said.Manappuram took over south-based Asirvad in February last year and has an 85per cent stake in it. Nandakumar said that the acquisition has proven to be successful one with the MFI nearly trebling its loan portfolio to Rs 998 crore at the end of March 2016 from a year ago. Its net profit also trebled to Rs 14 crore in FY16.The microfinance sector has come out of the woods since the disastrous 2010, and has been growing steadily ever since. The aggregate gross loan portfolio of all MFIs stood at Rs 53,233 crore, reflecting an 84 per cent year-on-year growth, with banks and investors loosening their purse-string.Manappuram is also planning to enter the micro housing loan segment to grow non-gold loan business."The banking licence guidelines seem to be more positive for us than expected," Nandakumar said, adding that the company has gone back to the drawing board to examine it thoroughly.

Manappuram sees 8-10 NBFCs in the race for banking foray | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram sees 8-10 NBFCs in the race for banking foray August 23, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share The RBI has released the guidelines for ‘on-tap’ licences for universal banks, which opens up a window of opportunity for non-banking finance companies. Earlier, 24 NBFCs had applied for bank licences, but only two — IDFC and Bandhan — got the coveted licence. This time around, more NBFCs could get through even though industrial houses will still be kept out of the banking business. Speaking to BTVI , Manappuram Finance MD and CEO VP Nandakumar says the company will be applying for the licence as it will help lower cost of funds and scale up business. Excerpts:The RBI has come up with the ‘on-tap’ bank licence guidelines. Why has the RBI kept the five-year perspective for applying for a universal bank licence? Earlier, you had mentioned that Manappuram will be looking at universal bank licence probably in the next five years. Will you be applying this time around?We had sought a 5-year time for applying for banking licence because more than 80 per cent of our assets under management are non-priority or gold loans. We have to immediately comply with the sectoral lending target. So it may take some time. Even the capital requirement is around Rs. 500 crore, which is much higher with regard to the capitalisation. When we compete with other banks, we need to be adequately capitalised. But having seen the RBI guidelines, I think we do not need to wait for five years provided we reach an agreement in the board.We can go even before that because the guidelines are rather facilitatory than the long-term vision as prescribed in the past. With a successful track record of 10 years, the applicant will be able to comply with this. So generally, I think it is a positive move and a facilitatory one. So I think we should be applying for the bank licence even earlier than what we have said in the past.Do you think the new guidelines are a move by the RBI to liberalise the banking regulation? Earlier, we had 24 applicants and out of that only two —IDFC and Bandhan —got the approval.How many firms do you think will apply this time around? Do you think this is a good policy framework?I think it is a good policy. NBFCs whose non-financial business contributes to the extent of 50 per cent of total loans can’t apply. Thereby, some industrial houses are barred. Whereas, NBFCs such as Manappuram are allowed. There could be 10-12 applications this time. I am hopeful that at least 80 per cent of them will get the licences.Link:-http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-news/manappuram-sees-810-nbfcs-in-the-race-for-banking-foray/article8936217.ece Previous NewsManappuram net zooms 170%Next NewsManappuram Finance gains on plan to raise Rs 150 crorePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

ICRA upgrades Manappuram finance ratings to AA Stable | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! ICRA upgrades Manappuram finance ratings to AA Stable July 19, 2019ManappuramManappuram Share ICRA has upgraded the long-term rating for the Rs. 192.97 crore NCD programmes of Manappuram Finance Limited(MAFIL) to [ICRA]AA- (pronounced ICRA double A minus) from [ICRA]A+ (pronounced ICRA A plus); and reaffirmed the short-term rating of [ICRA]A1+ (pronounced ICRA A one plus) for the Rs. 500.00 crore commercial paper programme of the company. ICRA has also withdrawn the rating of [ICRA]A1+ outstanding on the Rs. 1,524 crore short-term fund based facilities of the company, which was put on notice for withdrawal in January 2016.The revision in the long term rating factors in MAFIL’s improved business risk profile following its shift to shorter-tenure loans, the stability in the gold loan business pursuant to the various regulatory steps over the past few years, as well as the company’s comfortable capitalisation profile (consolidated gearing at 3.5 times as on March 31, 2016).The ratings continue to factor in the company’s track record in the gold loan business, its good internal controls and audit systems, and its comfortable liquidity profile on the back of short tenured assets and, sizeable un-utilized bank lines (~Rs.1,500 crore as on March 31, 2016).The ratings however remain constrained on account of the company’s concentration on gold loan segment making it vulnerable to adverse movements in gold prices, its marginal borrower profile and geographically concentrated operations (southern states constituting about 65% of portfolio) notwithstanding the improvement witnessed over the last 3-4 years. ICRA nevertheless takes note of the improved and a stable regulatory environment for gold loan companies currently, which is expected to support a steady and sustainable business growth. MAFIL’s ability to improve its operating efficiencies by achieving optimal business growth amidst a competitive business environment would be a key rating sensitivity.MAFIL has taken several initiatives in recent years to de-risk its gold loan portfolio from gold price volatility. The company has been gradually shifting towards shorter tenure gold loan products (3, 6 and 9 month tenure as against 12 months tenure earlier); the share of 3-month loans increased during the last financial year and stood at about 80% of the total disbursements in Q4FY2016 as compared to 44% in Q4FY2015. From April 2016, all incremental loans have been of tenure of 3 months. The shift towards shorter tenure loans along with tighter collections (with an effort to collect interest on a monthly basis) and prompt auctioning procedures (gold is now auctioned within 5-6 months, from the loan origination date, for 3 month tenure loans rather than 14-16 months earlier for 12 month tenure loans) is likely to reduce the impact of unfavourable gold price movements on the overall credit risk profile of the company. So far, the shift in loan tenures have not had an adverse impact on the company’s gold loan portfolio growth, which was about 12% during FY2016 against CAGR of 6.6% during the five year period ending FY2016. ICRA takes note of the steady increase in the share of loan renewals post the contractual maturity (upto 3 months from the maturity month), which stood at about 53% (about 46% of the loans were closed) for Q4FY2016 as compared to 19% (about 70% of the loans were closed) for Q4FY2015. ICRA also notes that the trend in fresh disbursements has been largely stable with about 89-90% being extended to existing customers (loan renewals and fresh loans) and the remaining to new customers. Going forward, it would be critical for the company to retain its customers and attract fresh customers, to grow its portfolio at an optimal rate in view of its shorter tenure loan offerings.ICRA takes note of the company’s initiatives to diversify its product portfolio to include segments like vehicle finance, loan against property, home finance (through Manappuram House Finance Private Limited; wholly owned subsidiary) and microfinance (through Asirvad Microfinance Private Limited; 90% subsidiary of MAFIL). While the total non-gold portfolio contributed to 12% of the company’s total consolidated portfolio of Rs. 11,433 crore as of March 31, 2016, the same is expected to increase to 20-25% by March 2018. ICRA takes note of the proposed aggressive expansion plans in the microfinance segment over the next two years at a CAGR of 55-65% through better penetration in the existing branches, and expansion to new geographies. Given MAFIL’s comfortable capitalisation currently, it may not require any significant capital infusion over the next 20-24 months to fund its overall consolidated portfolio growth targets. However, ability of MAFIL to demonstrate a profitable growth in the new product segments, without adversely impacting the asset quality profile would be also be a key rating sensitivity.MAFIL’s 90+ dpd reduced from 6.53% as on March 31, 2015 to about 1.41% as on March 31, 2016. ICRA notes that the company’s softer bucket delinquencies (0-60 days) could witness an increase following the complete transition to 3-month loans; slippages to harder buckets is expected to be limited as the company undertakes prompt recoveries and auctions on the overdue contracts.MAFIL’s return on average assets improved to 2.9% in FY2016 as against 2.4% in FY2015 aided by an improvement in the business yields and reduction in overall cost of funds. ICRA expects the incremental credit costs in the gold loan segment to remain within reasonable levels following the initiatives to de-risk the same; however, its ability to control credit costs in the other new segment remains to be seen. Further, MAFIL’s ability to grow the gold loan segment at an optimal pace with the existing branch network to improve its operating efficiencies (operating expenses as a % of average managed assets was high at 6.7% for FY2016) would be critical from a profitability perspective.MAFIL’s return on average assets improved to 2.9% in FY2016 as against 2.4% in FY2015 aided by an improvement in the business yields and reduction in overall cost of funds.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! See AUM, profit growth of 20-25% in FY17: Manappuram Fin June 07, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share he company, is confident of seeing reasonable growth of 20-25 percent in FY17 both in assets under management (AUM) and net profits, said VP Nandakumar, Chairman and Managing Director, Manappuram Finance.Manappuram Finance is targetting a growth of 20-25 percent in both assets under management (AUM) and profits in fiscal year 2016-17, says VP Nandakumar, Chairman and Managing Director.Speaking to CNBC-TV18, the gold loan provider chief said he is upbeat of growth in all the other segments like housing, commercial vehicle, micro finance and SME. Shares of Manappuram, which has a customer base of 20 lakh and 3300 branches across India, has posted superlative returns recently, having returned 24 percent, 70 percent and 100 percent in the past one month, six months or one year, respectively. The company recently introduced short-term loans of three months from twelve months, which has been a hit with customers because the interest burden reduces for short-term loans. “By changing the duration of products offered, average loan-to-value (LTV) has come down to 64 percent against regulatory cap of 75 percent,” he said. Below is the verbatim transcript of VP Nandakumar's interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.Sonia: The disbursement growth for the company has been very healthy, up almost about 56 percent. Do you think that a company like yours could perform as well as what you have done in the past and also there is so much competition now picking up in this space coming in from the smaller banks as well? What is the sense you are getting about how you could combat this kind of competition?A: Our Company is more focused on gold loan. We have 3,300 branches across India. We have a large customer base. The customer base is over 20 lakh now. So most of these customers are loyal customers as is seen by the repetition with which they are there over a period of time. So I see this quarter to be good because the demand is picking up. Q1 used to be good every year because the activities happening in the market like reopening of educational institutions etc and if monsoon is good as forecasted, the demand will pick up.As of now we see a reasonable growth and hopeful that we will be able to achieve around 20-25 percent growth during the current year and also in profit.Latha: About couple of years back you changed your strategy from 12 months financing to 3 months financing. Is that something that has significantly improved the quality of your business? Can you take us through this change of strategy?A: By changing the product from one year to three months and also offering the product for 12 months at a reduced loan-to-value (LTV), our average LTV has come down to around 64 percent now whereas our regulatory cap is around 75 percent. We are far below that and maybe the longest in the industry.However, another thing, being of a shorter duration, for the customer also it is good because otherwise if these are carried forward over a period of time, the interest burden also goes up and after one year he will find it difficult to redeem it and also we are offering a technology solution, online solution for repayment etc, so it is convenient for the customer. This has actually reduced our auction percentage around 1 percent which was hovering around 4 percent a year ago. So this proves that the strategy to switch to short-term loans in a commodity based lending is a prudent approach.Link:-http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/see-aum-profit-growth20-25fy17-manappuram-fin_6882581.html?utm_source=ref_article Previous NewsManappuram Finance hits over four-year high; zooms 100% in 2016Next NewsManappuram Finance plans co-branded debit card to expand gold loan businessPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Now, get gold loans online with Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Now, get gold loans online with Manappuram Finance August 27, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share Kochi, April 27 : Kerala-based NBFC Manappuram Finance has launched online gold loans (OGL), allowing customers with access to Net-enabled devices, to get gold loans anytime and from anywhere.However, borrowers have to make a visit to the company’s branch to get their gold ornaments appraised for purity and value. They will have to then hand over the gold to the branch for which a receipt will be given.Manappuram Finance will be responsible for the safe and secure storage of the jewellery, like the locker facility offered by banks.A credit limit of up to 75 per cent of the market value of the pledged gold ornaments will be sanctioned as OGL, wherein the customers can withdraw the amount using a smartphone, computer or other Internet-enabled devices. The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to customers’ bank account.The customer will also have the liberty to keep the pledged gold with the branches after repayment of the existing loans to get finance later.According to Sumitha Nandan, Senior Vice-President, OGL is essentially an extension of an existing facility wherein customers can make repayments of interest and principal through online channels.“Having succeeded with that, we realised we could do a lot more to carve a niche in the fin-tech space. Thus, the idea of a complete online process of gold loans came about,” she told BusinessLine.Manappuram had first launched OGL with basic access in October last year. The company later decided to spin off OGL into a separate vertical.After taking over as CEO of OGL, she said her first task was to make the product compatible with the smartphone. A simple, user-friendly Android-based app was launched in March, which has now crossed more than 10,000 downloads. An app based on the IOS platform is also on the cards.Nandan is now leading a small, focussed team of 10 officials working on the mandate to popularise OGL across the country, as the company expanded its branch network to 3,300 locations.“Despite minimum publicity and promotional activity, OGL was off to a rousing start. We have now rolled out a 100-day plan targeting a total of one lakh customers and one tonnes of gold by May end,” she adds.While the enrolment of customers is short of expectations, Nandan said that her team has done well to mobilise more than 500 kg of gold jewellery as collateral with a total outstanding of ₹100 crore.With customer feedback, she said the company intends to soon roll out an improved version of the Android app as the existing one showed some limitations in its ability to handle volumes.Manappuram Finance hopes to extend this concept even further with a co-branded debit card that would allow customers to withdraw the amount from an ATM anywhere in the country, she added.

The non-banking finance company's collections have improved, even as its growth has been robust, he said. Manappuram is betting on new initiatives such as micro finance, home finance and commercial vehicle finance segments to drive its performance. As on March 31, the assets under management of its microfinance business is over Rs 1000 crore. And Nandakumar is hoping he could grow the MFI segment to Rs 3000 crore in the next two-three years. As some of the microfinance companies are reshaping into small finance banks, big ones like Manappuram will gain in the near-term, he said. Companies such as Manappuram will be able to source funds at cheaper rates once competition moves away, he said. With some help from a good monsoon, he said, the company can loan to customers at a cheaper rate.Link: http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/co-poised-to-grow-at-cagr20next-few-years-manappuram_6401821.html?utm_source=ref_article Previous NewsNow, get gold loans online with Manappuram FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Manappuram Finance looks at inorganic growth to diversify business | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Manappuram Finance looks at inorganic growth to diversify business August 26, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share Mumbai:Kerala-based Manappuram Finance, a major name in gold-based loans, wishes to grow its non-gold loan book.“We are looking at organic and inorganic growth to grow the non-gold loan business, now Rs 1,300 crore. In the next two to three years, we aim to grow it to Rs 4,000 crore,” said V P Nandakumar, managing director and chief executive.No funds had been set aside for this, but capital adequacy was a comfortable 25.4 per cent at end-December 2015, he said. The non-gold loan book consists of financing for small and medium enterprises, commercial vehicle loans, and affordable housing. It is 12-13 per cent of the total loan book.The aim is to raise this to about 25 per cent in the next two years.This is being done to reduce concentration risk from gold loans. The Reserve Bank of India has also said it wants large companies to diversify their portfolio, as a single business will lead to this risk.Going ahead, it will look at further diversification and explore opportunities for lending in other segments, too. "Niche segments", said Nandakumar, where non-bank finance companies are typically not present.He says he also expects the gold loan business also to grow at a better pace than last year, as volatility in prices has stabilised. “Last year, we grew about 13 per cent here. This year, I think we should be able to clock a growth of 20 per cent,” he said.At the end of December, assets under management were Rs 10,579 crore. Earlier, the management had drafted a 'Vision 2020' plan forbusiness revenue of Rs 50,000 crore and to upgrade its assets under management to Rs 30,000 crore.Link:-http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/manappuram-finance-looks-at-inorganic-growth-to-diversify-business-116042500893_1.html Previous NewsNow, get gold loans online with Manappuram FinanceNext NewsConsolidated AUM will grow to more than Rs 14,000 crore: VP Nandakumar, Manappuram FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Consolidated AUM will grow to more than Rs 14,000 crore: VP Nandakumar, Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Consolidated AUM will grow to more than Rs 14,000 crore: VP Nandakumar, Manappuram Finance April 01, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share In a chat with ET Now, VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance, says very optimistic about maintaining a steady growthET Now: What to your mind is the outlook on gold finance right now? What do you think is the opportunity and size here and what is the current market share that you are working with?VP Nandakumar: The demand appears to be robust. I see an opportunity to grow at a rate of 20 per cent CAGR in the coming years and the gold being bought to the country never got reduced. It is around 1000 tonnes a year and around 80 per cent is going to the jewellery sector. So that demand will be always there. This is our expectation. This year also, we are able to cross our gold AUM to more than Rs 10000 crore. It is a reasonable growth.ET Now: Q3 AUM growth was about 20 per cent. Can we expect better trends in FY17 because analysts see growth of Rs 16,000 crore for AUM from Rs 10,000 crore odd at present. Is that a fair estimate?VP Nandakumar: Yes, I hope that consolidated AUM grows to more than Rs 14,000 crore. This is our expectation for the year 2016-2017. Out of that, the gold would be more than Rs 11000 crore.ET Now: In our recent interactions with the management not just you, with the management at large you have suggested a product mix change as well can you elaborate a bit on that?VP Nandakumar: Microfinance is around 1000 crore now the home loans would be around 140 crore similar would be the size of commercial vehicle loan segment also. The SME sector we have just started it would be around 50 crore because we have just started so the three put together will be more than 300 crore and gold AUM would be more than 10000 crore this is the position of various segments as of now. So this year also we were able to grow at a reasonable pace in the next two-three years my assumption is the other segments would be around 25 per cent of the consolidated AUM. Recently we have hiked our share in Asirvad Micro Finance to 91 per cent through further infusion. These segments are growing at a steady pace and next year I am very optimistic about maintaining a steady growth.ET Now: What is the kind of growth that you see for MFI vehicle finance as well as mortgages? What we are trying to gauge here is what is the customer profile here?VP Nandakumar: For gold loans, the customer profile will remain the same. For microfinance also, we will be continue with that JLG model. In home finance, we are more into affordable housing. Our average ticket size remains around Rs 15 lakh, so it will continue in the same way. SME also is around Rs 15 lakh. It will continue the same way. So, I do not anticipate much change in the customer profile in the coming years.ET Now: So over the next one or two years, how will your AUM mix look like between gold and the non-gold loan book?VP Nandakumar: 25 per cent would be non-AUM assets and 75 per cent will be gold assets. This is our expectation.ET Now: Because of the above changes, will you see margin expansions kicking in?VP Nandakumar: No, it is a reasonably good net interest margin.ET Now: Analysts have been estimating that your ROA can improve to about 2.5 to 3 per cent. Is this a fair assumption? If so, how will the key drivers for the improvement in return ratios kick in?VP Nandakumar: The major reasons have bee product restructuring and interest collections. Because of the product restructuring into short term products, the possibility of the laws on account of auction has been considerably reduced. The other factor is that like EMIs, we are collecting interests monthly so the receivables which are the interest receivables are accrued but not collected. It is below 3.5 per cent now which was around 7 per cent one year back. That means the interest collection has considerably improved. There are theories that the loss on account of auction will be much less and we were able to bring down the auction to around one-fourth which is the major reason for improving the ROA. I hope the ROA can be maintained at a rate of above 3.5 per cent.Link: http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-04-01/news/71977270_1_vp-nandakumar-gold-loans-manappuram-finance Previous NewsManappuram Finance looks at inorganic growth to diversify businessNext NewsExpect 10-15% growth in FY16: Manappuram Gen FinancePost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Expect 10-15% growth in FY16: Manappuram Gen Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Expect 10-15% growth in FY16: Manappuram Gen Finance March 14, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share Product restructuring will boost quality of earnings in the fourth quarter, says VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO of Manappuram General Finance. He expects a 10-15 percent growth in the current year.The company has recently diversified into different verticals like commercial vehicles (CVs) and lending to medium and small manufacturing enterprises (MSMEs) that will add to the growth, he adds.This year (first), Mannapuram expects CV portfolio to be at Rs 125-140 crore and grow to Rs 350-400 crore next year. MSME portfolio will be at Rs 50 crore in the first year and is expected to grow to Rs 150-200 crore in the subsequent year.Adding to the growth will also be the company’s newly added Gold Loan facility, which ensures timely interest collection and comfort to the customers, he says.Below is the transcript of VP Nandakumar’s interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.Sonia: Last quarter was quite good, you saw a 15 percent disbursement growth quarter-on-quarter. What about Q4? How has it shaped up so far and what is the expectation on disbursement?A: Q4 also, the quality of our earnings will be better, because of the product restructuring. Earlier, one year loan has been brought down to three year loan. So, the collections are better. And also because of the thrust we give to regular interest collection at monthly rests mostly. This has improved the quality of the asset. So, the earnings would be better. That is major reason.Latha: Did I get you right? What you are saying is that now, you are giving more shorter term loans and instead of a bullet repayment at the end of the loan term, you are taking monthly or quarterly repayments?A: No, monthly interest collection has been strengthened. For that, the technology is of help to us because we have introduced an online payment system whereby the customer can use his mobile and through his mobile, he is in a position to make payments from anywhere in the world 24x7. So, this has given comfort to the customers. So, because of this, the collections has become almost regular. That is the major reason.And through this we are able to get growth also. We are expecting a growth of around 10-15 percent. Last quarter also, we are expecting almost the same growth. The other thing is our diversification . We have recently diversified into three areas either through subsidiary route or from our own books. These are also going well. These are the major reasons.Sonia: The last time when we spoke with you, you said that the diversifications had just begun, so it would be too early to give us any details. But tell us a little bit about the commercial vehicle (CV) business, the housing and the microfinance business that you have diversified into and what kind of growth do you expect to see from those verticals over the next one to two years?A: One diversification is into CV area. During the first year of operation, our portfolio would be expected to be around Rs 125-140 crore during the first year. And we expect that to grow to a reasonable size to around Rs 350-400 crore in the next year. And the quality of the assets so far is very good and our primary thrust is to maintain the quality.Regarding the other diversification into home finance through a 100 percent subsidiary, that also is showing a reasonable growth with quality assets too. Our yield there is around more than 14 percent. We expect that to grow to around more than 15 percent with some small and medium enterprise (SME) lending also, which is permissible for a home finance company.The other diversification is lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) with a collateral security option. That also is growing. It will be around Rs 50 crore during the first year. Next year, that is expected to grow to around Rs 150-200 crore. So these are all growing.Then we are going to microfinance, through an inorganic route acquiring Asirwad Microfinance company. Since we took it over, that company has grown to around more than Rs 900 crore and next year, I hope the company can grow and reach as high as nearly Rs 2,000 crore. This is our expectation.So these initiatives are going well. We provide them regular support. In microfinance we have the highest stake of 91 percent now. These are the areas. So, a few things I can shortlist.One because of the collection efficiency, we have introduced even in gold loan, we have efficiently introduced monthly collection system, especially giving support to the customer through technology. And recently we have introduced online gold loan where our customer can park their gold in any of our branches and avail the loan at anytime of his choice.Latha: If you can just give us two numbers. What is the kind of overall gold assets under management (AUM) growth you are seeing in FY17 and what percentage of your total AUM will be your non-gold business in FY17?A: FY17, we have projected around 15 percent AUM growth in gold. In other areas, all put together would be around Rs 2,500-3,000 crore. These are our projections and we expect a bottomline also to grow at a rate of 20-25 percent.Link:-http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/expect-10-15-growthfy16-manappuram-gen-finance_5859861.html?utm_source=ref_article Previous NewsConsolidated AUM will grow to more than Rs 14,000 crore: VP Nandakumar, Manappuram FinanceNext NewsQ3 growth was driven by micro, housing finance: Manappuram FinPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Q3 growth was driven by micro, housing finance: Manappuram Fin | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Q3 growth was driven by micro, housing finance: Manappuram Fin February 15, 2016ManappuramManappuram Share Kapil Krishan, CFO of Manappuram Finance, says the company's cost of funds came down 50 basis points sequentially which aided to its net-interest margins (NIMS).Manappuram Finance’s overall assets under management (AUM) growth year-on-year (YoY) stood at 20 percent for the quarter ended December (Q3), says Kapil Krishan, CFO of the company. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Krishan says the company's growth was driven by new areas like micro finance and housing finance. Its micro-finance subsidiary is scaling up well with a 30 percent growth, he says. Further, the company's cost of funds came down 50 basis points sequentially which aided to its net-interest margins (NIMS), he says, adding, he expects NIMS to sustain at 14.5 percent. Below is the verbatim transcript of Kapil Krishan's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18. Sonia: Take us through what led to good quarter this time around and whether this growth that you are seeing both in terms of asset quality that is stable and net interest income (NII) growth whether it is sustainable? A: Yes, basically we had restructured our product offering almost a year ago where we had started focusing on a shorter tenure loan. As a result of which our net yield has gone up by 200 basis points (bps) because now all the interest is received by us. Earlier in the longer-term products, some of the interest was accrued but not collected finally. So because of this 200 bps increase in our net yield, that is the main contributor. Also, we have diversified and entered into some new areas like microfinance and housing finance those businesses are also scaling up and now the new businesses constitute around little over 8 percent of our total AUM. So the growth in the book has come because of the diversification and the income growth has come because of the increase in net yield.Latha: Generally, what has been the AUM growth and do you think Q4 will hold on in terms of AUM growth?A: So our overall AUM growth as 20 percent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) and 3.5 percent sequentially and our gold holding, which is the underlying volumes are also up by 22 percent Y-o-Y and 2 percent sequentially. So the underlying fundamentals are strong and our microfinance subsidiary is scaling up very well. It grew 30 percent sequentially and 117 percent Y-o-Y. We expect that growth to continue to be very strong. So we expect to maintain this momentum.Sonia: Microfinance you are seeing a strong 30 percent growth, what about housing finance? Can you throw some more colour on how much it has grown in this quarter and what is the sustainable rate of growth?A: So the housing finance is a new business that we have set up. Therefore there is no Y-o-Y growth that we talk about but sequentially it has grown. We are just setting up the branches and it is around Rs 100 crore AUM as of today but as the new branches mature, the growth momentum will suddenly pick up which we expect in FY17 should be up substantially.Latha: Your net interest margins (NIMs) has gone up significantly to 14.5 percent. You see it maintaining there?A: Yes. Our cost of funds has come down again by 50 bps sequentially and the banks benefit was around 30 bps. Banks are around 75 percent of our total borrowing mix. So around 20 bps saving was because of the base rate cut and we are now negotiated much better borrowing rates from the banks so we are borrowing at base rate now and we have also increased the commercial vehicle component. So the cost of funds has also helped the NIM and as we discussed the yield also went up. So this will be sustained.Latha: 14.5 percent margins and AUM of 20 percent you will be able to sustain?A: Y-o-Y, we are expecting to maintain this figure.Sonia: Since about Rs 90 crore of your portfolio comes from the commercial vehicle space and you did mention that you are planning to increase it, can you give us some colour on whether the worst is over as far as asset quality concerns are from that space itself and what the growth could be?A: It is a very new business for us. So we do not have the legacy asset quality issues that some of the largest players have and we have adopted a conservative strategy. So we are not chasing business where we see any risk and our book is not matured but we do not expect any major issues.Link:-http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/resultsboardroom/q3-growth-was-driven-by-micro-housing-finance-manappuram-fin_5473781.html Previous NewsExpect 10-15% growth in FY16: Manappuram Gen FinanceNext NewsDiversifying business beyond gold loans: ManappuramPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Diversifying business beyond gold loans: Manappuram December 15, 2015ManappuramManappuram Share In an interview with CNBC-TV18, VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO, Manappuram General Finance , discussed the ramifications of the gold price fall on the company's business and what it is doing to counter it.Below is the verbatim transcript of VP Nandakumar’s interview with Reema Tendulkar & Nigel D'Souza on CNBC-TV18.Nigel: We are couple of months already into this quarter, in the last quarter itself we did see a growth has stagnated after quite a few quarters is it looking better this time around?A: The growth all depends upon the gold price. As far as our main business is concerned gold loan we are growing our gold collateral with us, the security with us steadily. This year we have grown that around 15 percent.However the asset under management (AUM) has not grown to that extent so last one or two quarters it is remaining more or less stable there. However, the collateral is growing because the loan to value (LTV) is coming down because the gold price has gone down. As far as we are concerned we have diversified into other areas and those new businesses are growing.Reema: What you are saying that the total assets under managements or AUM as we call it would largely be flat in Q3 that is the quarter we are in? If you could also break that up in terms of gold AUM as well as non-gold AUM because you have been focusing a lot on disbursements in the non-gold AUM market as well?A: So far the total AUM has grown during this quarter by around 1.5 percent. This is mostly due to non-gold AUM. Gold AUM is stable at the same levelReema: So overall AUM growth in this quarter so far is 1.5 percent driven by non-gold. Gold AUMs would be flat.A: Yes.Nigel: The gross yields were at around 21.5 percent and they were soft on year-on-year just in the last quarter due to interest reversals on the auction portfolio. Now analyst on the street they expect yields to go back to around that 23 percent approximately is that happening?A: It is happening. I am glad to say this is happening because the legacy portfolio which was there longer-term that portfolio is over. So, now around two-third of our portfolio is of a short-term nature around the three months time. So, the there is no cause of concern of interest reversal now. So, the yield will go to that level of 23 percent.Nigel: Your legacy book was around Rs 800 crore?A: Yes, now those are all redeemed or all these are cleared.Link:http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/diversifying-business-beyond-gold-loans-manappuram_4580201.html?utm_source=ref_article Previous NewsQ3 growth was driven by micro, housing finance: Manappuram FinNext NewsManappuram Finance launches video conferencing facilityPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

Soon, e-lockers may replace traditional ones at Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Soon, e-lockers may replace traditional ones at Manappuram Finance March 31, 2015The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share Kochi, March 31: An Internet-based keyless, fully automated and secure e-lockers may soon replace the traditional lockers for gold storage at Manappuram Finance.The e-lockers will be completely managed (opening, closing, auditing, remote monitoring etc) through encrypted IT systems.The development of such an e-locker system is expected to benefit customers by providing greater security.Mohan Vizhakat, Chief Technology Officer, Manappuram Finance, says that the gold loan business hinges on the 19th century technology of mechanical lockers for gold storing even though all other aspects of business have been modernised.Hence developing an e-locker system is the need of the hour as manually operated lockers have certain vulnerabilities because of the need to open it frequently as well as threats to extract keys of the mechanical lockers, he said. The Kerala-based NBFC is developing such an advanced technology application solely with the aim of transforming the gold loan business.He told BusinessLine that the e-locker system could further be developed to offer new products such as gold deposit services, online gold loans for customers, etc. The use of such cutting-edge technologies will make business transactions convenient and transparent.Investment for researchAsked how e-lockers will benefit, Vizhakat said that it would help shrink the size of many conventional branches into small kiosks. This would reduce operating expenses and facilitate opening of more outlets at places where customers need immediate gold loans. For this transformation, the company has lined up investments worth ₹40 crore in R&D projects for developing Internet-based products. The usage of M2M (machine to machine) communications protocol will enable remote monitoring of gold stored inside e-lockers and even automated auditing through the centrally-controlled IT systems.There are plans to put in place a biometric ‘eKYC authentication system’ allowing direct interface with UIDAI to establish the authenticity of the Aadhar cards presented at the branches. Steps are also on to launch ‘e-wallet cards’ to avoid cash transactions for customers who lack access to bank accounts.To spearhead similar and future innovations, he said the company is setting up an entirely new institution – Manappuram Centre of Excellence and Innovation (MaCE Inn) — at Bengaluru.Manappuram, which was recently awarded the KMA-Nasscom IT Innovations Award, was among the first NBFCs to build and operate an IT-system based on a centrally managed application.

We plan to reduce our gold loan portfolio to 50% in 10 years, says VP Nandakumar, CEO of Manappuram Finance | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! We plan to reduce our gold loan portfolio to 50% in 10 years, says VP Nandakumar, CEO of Manappuram Finance December 11, 2020Money ControlManappuram Share We will primarily remain a gold loans NBFC, but we want to scale up our affordable housing business to 20% in 10 years, says VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO of Manappuram Finance. Manappuram Finance wants to diversify its loan portfolio for better risk management. The Kerala-based NBFC plans to reduce its exposure to gold loans from 95 percent to 65 percent in three to four years, and 50 percent in seven to ten years. 'We want to scale up our affordable housing business to 20 percent in ten years,' VP Nandakumar, MD and CEO of Manappuram Finance, tells Neha Bothra in an interview. This is part of the lender's long term strategy, but in the current fiscal year the non-gold business is likely to 'remain at the same level or show a marginal growth' of around 4 percent. While disbursals and collections have reached pre-Covid levels, Nandakumar expects an 'ultimate loss of 5 percent' in loan recovery. The gold loan business is expected to grow at 20 percent this fiscal, but the uptrend in gold prices is a concern. In this chat, Nandakumar outlines the company's long term business strategy, and discusses the performance and growth outlook for its gold, affordable housing and microfinance portfolios. Edited excerpts: The havoc caused by COVID-19 hurt earnings. Do you think the pain is largely behind the business now? It appears like that because our presence is largely in rural and semi urban areas, and the activities have somewhat reached normalcy. Semi-urban transportation has been re-established, and shops, small manufacturing units, auto industries are now working, and some construction activity is also going on. But, we see some softness in government (spending) and the road construction sector. Overall, there is a positive attitude, and business is almost back to 90 percent normalcy.

Microfinance players expect loan repayments to start soon | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Microfinance players expect loan repayments to start soon June 01, 2020Hindu Business LineManappuram Share No legacy, they say, is as rich as honesty. Perhaps, India’s micro lenders can vouch for this. With an outstanding loan portfolio of ₹2.2 lakh crore, the microfinance industry caters to a vast majority of the population in the informal sector which includes daily-wagers, small businesses, kirana shops and agricultural workers. But the recovery rate of more than 98 per cent can put even corporate borrowers to shame.The pandemic-induced lockdown has disrupted the disbursement and recovery process of the industry, which predominantly depends on cash settlements, field visits and group meetings. However, microfinance companies are confident that the industry, which is known for its resilience, will bounce back soon after the economic activities are started.“I have been in the sector for the last 18-20 years and have seen several cycles of ups and downs. My personal belief is that small businesses have good strength to bounce back. All they need is a few thousand rupees to make them stand again,” Vivek Tiwari, MD & CEO of SATYA MicroCapital said, adding: “once the disbursement is continued the sector will be normalised in 4-6 months.”The granular nature of the portfolio, small size of loans, high level of customer connect, balanced mix of urban and rural clients and a very strong credit discipline of the micro borrowers are some of the major advantages for the sector.The RBI’s three-month loan moratorium came as a major reprieve for the small borrowers, whose livelihood was thrown out of gear by the sudden lockdown. However, with the relaxation on lockdown guidelines in many parts of the country, microfinance lenders say that majority of the borrowers have started repayment instead of taking the second moratorium.“Finance always sits on the bedrock of credit culture. Any disruption in credit culture is not good for the industry,” SV Raja Vaidyanathan, MD & CEO of Asirvad Microfinance said, adding: “but the blessing in disguise is that, when RBI created moratorium, it said that moratorium interest will be charged from day one.” Read more Previous NewsGold loans shine among small businessesNext NewsCovid-19: Gold loan capacity rushes to record peaks amid the pandemicPost Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

The Not-So-United Kingdom | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! The Not-So-United Kingdom December 14, 2022Unique TimesManappuram Share Article ByV P NandakumarMD & CEO Manappuram Finance Ltd The socio-economic situation in the United Kingdom seems to be going from bad to worse to calamity. The wounds of Brexit were still raw when Covid-19 happened and the country suffered an economic slump, the kind of which has not been seen in three centuries. Boris Johnson had to call it quits after a series of unpopular decisions and then it was the turn of Liz Truss to throw in the towel.She had taken over as PM with a promise to undo the damage and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Karteng echoed her but in the absence of credible steps in the September 23 mini budget, financial markets reacted with a vengeance, plunging the nation into a mood of despondency. The first casualty was Kwarteng’s chair. Prime Minister Truss put up a brave face and continued to assuage sentiments but the turbulence that followed was too much for her to stomach, compelling her to resign admitting that she failed to deliver her promise.Unsurmountable problemsThe measures sought to be reversed were unpopular tax proposals, on the premise that low taxes would spur economic growth and help bridge temporary revenue shortfalls. The proposals included reversing a hike in National Insurance taxes, a cut in basic income tax rate from 20% to 19%, reduction in peak income tax from 45% to 40%, nixing a planned 6% increase in corporate tax rate and capping gas and electricity bills for households and businesses. But since the mini budget didn’t outline tangible steps to make good the revenue shortfall, market players expected public debt to rise. Confidence got further eroded by the fact that the growth slump continued unabated.The unprecedented crisis has taken a toll on the country’s financial system, impacting several segments. Long term bond yields hardened due to a rise in fiscal deficit and government borrowings. The 10 Yr benchmark UK government bond yield has hardened by 100 bps in the past one year, crossing 4%. This comes on top of pressures already being faced by UK bonds because of spiralling inflation. Consumer price inflation has been in the 9-10% range for more than six months now, very high by developed market standards.Taking a ‘pound’ingThe Pound Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value in the past one year, thanks to weak investor sentiments, rising debt concerns and falling economic growth. Being a net importer of fuel and energy, a weak pound threatens to accentuate inflation. Bank of England would be forced to further raise the key policy rate to prevent further weakening of the pound and to control inflation.Another concern has been rising mortgage costs, mainly due to three reasons: First, Bank of England hiked its policy rate by 150 bps since the month of May; Second, banks had to increase interest rates on loans to compensate for the fall in treasury profits and finally, expectations of future rate hikes by BoE also made the banks to front load interest rate hikes. Mortgage rates have hardened from 2.25% a year ago to 6% and is expected to go up by another 1%.A major fallout of the crisis has been cash flow issues being faced by UK Pension Funds. Pension funds optimise their risk by investing in long dated bonds (as retirements happen in future) and simultaneously buying derivatives to hedge the investment risks. While hedging, the pension funds offer collateral and when bond yields rise rapidly more collateral is offered. Because of rising yields, these Pension Funds faced a £1.6 bn cash margin call and apparently had to dump assets to meet the requirement. This sale of bonds once again led to a vicious cycle of falling bond prices and rising yields. To defuse the crisis, Bank of England announced that it will buy bonds up to £65bn which has helped bring down bond yields and provide some relief to pension funds. Had it not intervened, pension funds would have defaulted on margin calls and a major crisis would have followed.Implications for IndiaWhat are the implications for India? To be sure, India cannot be insulated in a globalised world. In FY22, India’s exports of goods and services to the UK constituted 2.5% of our total exports. Hence there would be some impact. The impact on the Indo-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed recently has to be monitored as its full execution would benefit exports of sectors like textiles. On the FDI front, however, the impact looks negligible as the total FDI inflows from UK to India constituted only $1.6bn in FY2022.There is no doubt that the UK is at an inflection point. The new administration led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has its task cut out — to earn the trust and confidence of the public and continue with bold reforms. Meanwhile, India will watch the unfolding scenario from the sidelines with keen interest.

Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! Kerala bankers welcome MPC’s decision; say it will keep inflation anchored, support growth December 08, 2022The Hindu BusinesslineManappuram Share The outcome of the MPC meeting is in tune with most estimates and leaves no surprises. In my view, by going for a moderate hike to take the policy repo rate to 6.25%, the MPC has taken one more step closer to arrive at a `neutral rate’ though it is difficult to hazard a guess about the figure at this point of time. Also, inflationary pressures remain key to how the macro situation will pan out in the near-term while keeping growth on projected track. On the balance, the policy is rightfully optimistic about the resilience of the domestic economy without throwing caution against inflation and the spillover effect of continuing shocks to global growth to the winds.-- V.P.

We expect 5-10% growth in AUM and profitability’- V P Nandakumar | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! We expect 5-10% growth in AUM and profitability’- V P Nandakumar November 15, 2022ManappuramFinancial Express Share There has been a healthy growth in profitability, sequentially as well as on a YoY basis, while a steady AUM was maintained.Manappuram Finance expects the momentum in profitability to continue in the next two quarters. Margin pressures are likely to come down going forward, VP Nandakumar, MD & CEO, tells Sajan C Kumar.He says there is always space for banks, fintechs and non-banks to coexist by complementing each other amid healthy competition as the credit market in India is far from reaching saturation. Excerpts:How was the second quarter in terms of performance? There has been a decline of 6.54% in gold loan disbursements. Is it an industry trend or anything specific to the company ?There has been a healthy growth in profitability, sequentially as well as on a YoY basis, while a steady AUM was maintained. For the six months ended September, our profitability stood at Rs 700 crore. The profit after tax grew 10.7% on a YoY basis and 45.2% sequentially. We have also increased headcount by 6,000 during Q2 to ensure better customer service. A marginal fall in gold loan disbursals is an industry trend and as the economy revives, we hope to put up an improved performance in coming quarters. Also, we are not interested in going for unhealthy competition.Will there be margin pressure going forward due to competition from banks and fintechs?We do not anticipate further margin pressure as we do not intend to undercut interest rates or indulge in unsustainable and unhealthy competition. The sense we get is that inflation has probably peaked and the pace of interest rate hike is set to slow down. This will have a positive bearing on cost of funds. Moreover, there is always space for banks, fintechs and non-banks to coexist by complementing each other even amid healthy competition, as the credit market in India is far from reaching saturation.What is the outlook for the quarter and the fiscal? What kind of an AUM and gold loan growth do you expect for the whole of FY23?We expect the momentum in profitability to continue in the next two quarters as well. As stated earlier, margin pressures are expected to come down in ensuing quarters. Fiscal 2023 should end on a very good note as we will reap the full impact of the economic revival by the close of this fiscal. Having seen the industry trend and considering the demand pick up that is underway, we expect 5-10% growth in AUM and profitability.How has the new customer acquisition been during Q2FY23?Compared to Q1, we have added more than 1 lakh customers during Q2 across verticals. As demand is expected to be healthy, we expect this momentum to continue.What about the cost of funds?Our cost of funds declined to 7.80% for Q2, from 7.94% in the year-ago period. However, compared to Q1FY23, our cost of funds increased by 33 bps as interest rates remained elevated during this period. However, we do not expect cost of funds to incrementally rise as interest rates seem to have more or less peaked.How are your non-gold businesses doing? Will the share of non-gold businesses increase in coming quarters?Our non-gold businesses are doing very well. Microfinance AUM is now at Rs 7,661 crore. Commercial vehicle portfolio has seen a growth of 49% YoY while our home loan portfolio grew more than 25%. Non-gold AUM share in the total business has increased from 34% to 37% in Q2. This is a conscious strategy of diversification that we are following to arrive at a balanced portfolio.What about expansion of branches, immediate fundraising plans, NCDs, etc?We would like to expand branch network and have sought permission from the RBI. As and when we get the required permissions, we would initiate this process. Our capital and liquidity position is robust at present.Read More Previous NewsKerala bankers welcome MPC’s decision; say it will keep inflation anchored, support growthNext NewsWhy is gold losing lustre?Post Comments Name Email MessagePost CommentPreview Trending News MANAPPURAM FINANCE TURNS 75 Jun 01 2024 1 min read Manappuram Finance Ltd Unveils Innovative ‘Make Life Easy With Doorstep Gold Loan’ Campaign To Revolutionize Gold Loan Accessibility Nationwide Apr 01 2024 2 min read VP Nandakumar Honored With Financial Success Champion Award Feb 14 2024 1 min read In A Sweet Spot Feb 19 2024 3 min read The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity Feb 19 2024 4 min read Recent News നാല് കോടി രൂപയുടെ ധനസഹായം പ്രഖ്യാപിച്ച് മണപ്പുറം ഫിനാൻസ് Aug 16 2024 1 min read Diwali Ad-Campaign 'Spread Happiness' coverage appeared in Adgully.

The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content NewsStay Informed with the Latest Financial Updates, Market Trends, and Expert Analysis. Stay Ahead with Manappuram Finance! The Case For Improving Manufacturing Productivity February 19, 2024Unique TimesV.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO, Manappuram Finance Ltd Share To sustain growth momentum in the long run, the government and the industry along with financial institutions should roll out a synchronised policy to boost productivity in the key manufacturing sector that will generate quality jobs, higher income and enhanced demand There are no two opinions that Indian economy is expanding at a faster clip than projected earlier with National Statistics Office (NSO) revising up its FY ’24 GDP growth forecast in January. According to the First Advanced Estimates of National Income published by the NSO, the Indian real economy will grow at a faster pace of 7.3% this fiscal compared to the 7.2% it clocked during the previous fiscal. This is the most optimistic projection made by any agency so far and tops even the 7% predicted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its December policy statement.Arguably, services sector has become the rock star of India’s economic growth leading the league table with a projected reading of 7.7% in FY ’24, followed by a 6.5% expansion in manufacturing activity (up from 1.3% in the previous fiscal.) Of course, the spike in manufacturing activity is indeed commendable. But one needs to go beyond these numbers to get the real story on the manufacturing sector out. For this, one needs to look into the productivity growth in the core manufacturing sector. Since the statistical office does not give the productivity data, one may turn to the next best alternative; that is the Gross Value Added (GVA) which could be used as a proxy for productivity numbers. GVA is the value that different producers add to the value of goods at various stages of a product cycle.Going by the NSO numbers, the productivity growth in manufacturing is forecast to decline with GVA set to shrink to 4.4% (at current prices) in the current fiscal, from 7% in the previous fiscal. And this should be a concern for policy makers, especially when the nation is eyeing to become a developed economy by 2047. The point to note here is that a developed country by definition is a highly industrialised country with the lion’s share of national income or output coming from the core manufacturing.This takes us straight to the heart of the task in hand which, in my view, is a shared concern of all stakeholders. It is a truism that to sustain a higher growth momentum at above the 7% on a durable basis, the productivity expansion in manufacturing sector is key. By productivity, I mean the ratio of output to inputs including both capital and labour which is also called as total factor productivity in economic literature. Improving productivity in manufacturing is critical for the economy to grow at a higher rate since it lands the economy in a virtuous cycle with optimum resource mix leading to optimum output enhancing the competitiveness of the goods produced. Higher productivity also helps firms to enhance margins, scale and sometimes even scope of the production. This will lead to higher resource flow into the business vertical concerned.In other words, enhanced productivity will not only reduce the cost of manufactured goods in the domestic market leading to elevated demand, but also increase the scope of exports. This will help swell the foreign exchange coffers of the nation and shrink the import bill to a great extent. Another point to note here is that manufacturing creates more employment ensuring higher wages and salaries for the workers. This, in turn, will translate into higher consumption. This is very critical to sustain faster economic expansion since private final consumption (PFC) is the single largest contributor to economic growth. Going by the NSO data, private consumption contributes above 60% of the GDP growth. It goes without saying that private consumption is the fulcrum of Indian economy and faster growth of this variable can take India much closer to the developed nation status sooner than later. If any proof is needed, one only has to rewind to the Chinese economic growth a few decades ago to find voluminous testimonies to corroborate the manufacturing productivity hypothesis. The icing on the cake is that high productivity in manufacturing will trigger a fresh cycle of foreign capital inflows in the form of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).Therefore, it is my suggestion that the government and the industry along with financial institutions should roll out a synchronised policy to boost productivity in the key manufacturing sector that will generate quality jobs, higher income and enhanced demand putting the economy on a higher growth trajectory. On its part, policy makers should give a serious thought about extending the ambit of Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes to more verticals while business leaders should burn midnight oil to figure out ways to improve shop level productivity. On their part, financial institutions should reduce the cost of funds to individual firms based on not just their balance sheet strength but considering productivity gains at the firm level. Together, such a concerted effort will see the India’s transition to a developed economy at a much faster rate.

In A Sweet Spot February 19, 2024Unique TimesDr Sumitha Nandan, Executive Director, Manappuram Finance Ltd Share Commercial lenders including NBFCs are on a path of healthy growth despite tightening risk weight norms by the regulator Post-pandemic recovery in the banking sector has many surprises on the upside. The most important eye-opener was the steady growth in non-farm credit off-take which has defied many doomsday predictions. To be precise, the post-pandemic behaviour of the retail credit portfolio has improved both in terms of growth and risk parameters. Data indicates a significant improvement in asset quality parameters coupled with broad-based growth across retail loan segments. As J. Swaminathan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, said in a January 10 speech, “Undoubtedly, these are good times for the financial services industry, characterised by robust parameters of performance and soundness. This enviable position is owed, in no small measure, to the hard work and unwavering dedication of the compliance, risk management, and internal audit functions”.Indeed, commercial lenders including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have worked very well to ensure financial stability by sticking to compliance norms as detailed by the regulator. For instance, prudential norms on single and group entity exposures are strictly adhered to by banks and non-banks and have been instrumental in maintaining balance sheet strength. It is heartening to note that banks and NBFCs have achieved credit growth in double digits over the past decade despite exposure caps and limits while simultaneously improving asset quality.The growing use of technology and the pervasive digitalisation of finance, however, brings forth new challenges in the form of cyber-security risks. The regulator has recently exhorted fintech players to have a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) to ensure voluntary compliance posed by risks inherent to fintech lending. Very recently, the regulator has also cracked the whip on a digital player asking it to stop all deposits and credits and wallet top-ups henceforth. These measures should be read in consonance with measures announced recently to increase risk weights on unsecured lending. It will usher in financial stability by weeding out highly risky players and in effect serves to strengthen serious and prudent players in the system. The latest RBI Monthly Bulletin rightly points out that though the recent surge in credit flows has not resulted in stress build-up in the retail credit segment, policymakers may consider using structural prudential tools, viz., debt-service ratio and debt-to-income ratio of retail borrowers as additional monitoring metrics. Lenders should also use emerging technology ecosystem infrastructure such as account aggregators to strengthen credit underwriting. Such frameworks facilitate monitoring of borrower leverage in a holistic fashion.I may also mention here that contrary to several predictions, commercial lenders including NBFCs’ unsecured portfolio has seen healthy growth in the third quarter of current fiscal despite increase in risk weights. This is not surprising as most banks are capitalised well above the regulatory minimum. NBFCs are also in the same league as their average CRAR or risk weighted assets is more than 20% against the regulatory requirement of 15%. Hence, going forward, it is only logical to expect unhindered credit growth from both banks and NBFCs, provided they do not dilute their guard against credit risks and slippages.An unfinished goal, even as we are on track to reach the $5 trillion mark, is to achieve a greater degree of formalisation. NBFCs and banks are a vital cog in this battle as they ensure last mile credit delivery. The success achieved in the microfinance space bears testimony to this fact. This segment has been a win-win for both lenders and borrowers — for the lenders due to margin improvement and for borrowers due to hassle free credit access. Hence, I am of the view that the finance balancing act by lenders augur well for financial stability and growth.

The Social Relevance of Gold Loans | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Manappuram Finance Limited, has in recent years, emerged as a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India under the stewardship of Shri V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the Company. The Social Relevance of Gold LoansV.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO.In recent months, there’s been a spate of media articles focussed on the success enjoyed by the leading players in the gold loan segment (incidentally, one of India’s fastest growing businesses), and how more and more people are shedding age-old taboos to borrow money against their gold jewellery. While this traditional business of lending money against gold was professionalized and scaled-up in recent years by Kerala-based NBFCs, all the major national banks have now jumped into the fray with enthusiasm. Moreover, the media attention is not restricted to India alone. Both the New York Times (“Out from India’s alleys, gold loans gain respect,” September 28, 2009) and the Washington Post (“In India, gold loans gain popularity as precious metal's prices soar,” January 12, 2010) recently carried stories about the growing popularity of gold loans in India.It is therefore an apt moment to acquaint the reader with an insider’s perspective on why gold loans matter and why they hold so much promise for our country’s future.Gold and domestic savingsIn India the savings habits of the poor and lower classes differ significantly from the richer sections. While the rich invest their savings across many different kinds of assets, the poor continue to invest their savings mainly in gold. In fact, in rural areas, this is often a necessity because of lack of access to banks. Also, there are strong cultural factors at work in India which make gold not only a desirable but also a necessary asset to hold. Gold is traditionally a store of value, protecting our savings from inflationary devaluation. It also serves important ceremonial purposes, such as in a wedding celebration where gold is always the preferred gift. With increasing prosperity and sophistication, the relative importance of gold to the well-off may have declined, but among the poor it continues to rule.The debt-trapPeople in a rural, agrarian society will necessarily face the problem of fluctuating or unsteady incomes. The bulk of their earnings come in the two harvest seasons and the rest of the year can be difficult. It is no surprise that they frequently resort to borrowing money. Quite often, this involves a trip to the local money lender. The money lender is willing to oblige but the interest rates are sky-high which makes repayment a big concern. Loans go into a cycle of defaults and rollovers at ever higher rates of interest and, occasionally, the money lender ends up with the title to the property of the borrowers.This is the classic debt-trap and a root cause of so much distress among the rural poor.The road aheadIf only people would fall back on their savings in the form of gold, and borrow money at reasonable rates of interest against the pledge of their gold ornaments, the debt-trap can be curbed to a large extent. Yet it does not happen because we are all emotionally attached to our gold jewellery and, even in these more permissive times, there is a stigma attached to pledging gold to borrow money. In fact, it is considered a sign of desperation so that when people borrow against gold, they don’t want their neighbours to know of it. And so, the reality is that rather than use their gold to raise money, their instinctive preference is to go to a moneylender and borrow at exorbitant rates.Avoids debt trap: A gold loan is settled either by repayment or, in case of default, by sale of the pledged security. The cycle of non-payment and rollovers of the loan at escalating rates of interest does not happen. In the worst case the borrower may lose his gold but there is no debt trap.Simple procedures, fast disbursal: The formalities in availing gold loans are minimal and procedures are simple. In practice, the entire process should hardly take fifteen to twenty minutes. This makes gold loans ideal for the micro-finance segment where the loan amounts are small and where there is no point in testing the borrower’s patience with elaborate procedure.No depreciation of underlying asset: Unlike other secured loans, the underlying asset in a gold loan is not subject to depreciation. At the same time, unlike land, it is a liquid asset and the transaction costs involved when enforcing the security are minimal. Thanks to this, the lender always enjoys a degree of comfort not available in other loans, and he does not have to go chasing after the borrower for timely repayments of instalments or EMIs. As for a borrower facing temporary difficulties, the only compulsion is to keep on servicing the interest component, till his situation permits repayment.In practice, without recourse: Gold loans are effectively given out on a “without recourse” basis. Although the fine print of the loan agreement incorporates the right of recourse to the other assets of the borrower, in practice, this is almost never enforced. Defaults are settled by sale of the pledged gold and losses (if any) are written off. There are no recovery agents to go chasing after the borrower and his other properties with threats of legal action, court orders etc. In contrast, in a typical “secured” loan from a bank, in addition to the primary security, you need to put up collateral and bring along a Guarantor who also gets hauled into court in case of default.No questions asked: People often borrow money on account of social compulsions which cannot be avoided in our cultural context; occasions like weddings, festivals, religious and social obligations etc. In this context, there is no denying that India’s banking sector continues to carry a hangover from the days of credit rationing that bank lending must always be for “productive” purposes. On the other hand, gold loans recognise that someone urgently in need of money cannot instead be made to settle for a lecture on wasteful consumption. Money is advanced solely on the criterion of the value of gold pledged and questions about the purpose of the loan would only be to confirm that anti-social or wildly speculative activities are not involved.Suited for the unorganised sector: Gold loans are ideal for those employed in the informal or unorganised sector and lacking documents to prove their incomes. This is a segment conventional banks generally avoid because their appraisal and credit scoring is based on formal documentation. Incidentally, more than 90 percent of India’s workforce is employed in the unorganised sector.Moral pressure against default: The recent success of the micro-finance sector has brought attention to the advantage of the group approach when lending to the poor. The loan is extended to individuals in a group and a default by any one member leads to the entire group being denied subsequent loans. Therefore, there is collective moral pressure on each member from the rest of the group to repay in time.Something like this is at work in a gold loan too. There is no group approach but the market practice that gold loans are generally extended against household used jewellery has a similar impact. The fact is, borrowers and their families are emotionally attached to their family jewellery. Very often, it would have been acquired during important occasions like a marriage or the birth of a child etc. Occasions of wilful default, particularly with intention to capitalise on fluctuations in gold prices, are few and far between.It therefore stands to reason that banks and financial institutions that choose to scale-up their gold loan portfolios would be able to do so with minimum risks. And, from a regulator’s perspective, gold loans can actually serve to minimise systemic risks.Gains for the wider economy: India has the world’s largest stock of privately held gold with informed estimates ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of gold. When this gold is kept idle in our lockers and vaults, it is a drag on the Indian economy: it has the effect of keeping billions of dollars in savings (at a conservative price of $1,000 /oz., it amounts to about $480 to $ 650 billion) out of the financial system. This is a huge sum that otherwise could have been lent out to industries and for building infrastructure. When people borrow against gold (technically called “monetization”), the impact is to set in motion a whole new chain of economic activity boosting demand and consumption expenditure in the economy.The road aheadThere is now increasing recognition that economic and social policies need to be rooted in reality, not in any visions of an ideal world. Today, the ground realities are that significant sections of the rural poor continue to lack access to banks, either to park their savings in, or as a fallback for loans in times of need. Also, given the country’s atypical cultural context, gold continues to play an important part in our lives, reflected in the fact that India is consistently the world’s largest consumer of gold. Under these circumstances, the organised gold loan segment is potentially a vehicle for social transformation. Considering that 65 percent of our massive private stock of gold is held by rural households, and that 75 percent of the gold loan market continues to be with the unorganised sector (local moneylenders and pawnbrokers), this is a market with tremendous potential for growth.At the same time, there is an urgent need for the government and the regulators to recognise the professionalism and transparency that the organised sector brings to this field and encourage its growth. We need a radical shift in the regulatory approach, from one of tolerance with a multiplicity of hurdles, to that of facilitation and active promotion. A useful beginning can be made by not treating this sector on a par with local moneylenders and pawnbrokers. And, it will help if gold loans are not clubbed with other NBFC lending when prescribing regulatory capital.The distress faced by India’s farmers in recent years highlights the need to move on multiple fronts in extending timely credit to the rural masses. Gold loans must be made a part of this process.Note: An edited version of this article was published in the op-ed page of The Economic Times dated July 29, 2010 under the title “Gold Loans aid financial inclusion”.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/policy/Gold-loans-aid-financial-inclusion/articleshow/6230807.cms Blog May302025 How to Calculate Your Gold Loan Eligibility Amount: A Step-by-Step GuideSummary: You can calculate your gold loan eligibility by entering your gold's weight, type, and purity into an online gol May302025 What is the Minimum Weight Required for a Gold Loan?Summary: This guide explains the minimum gold weight required to apply for a gold loan, which varies by lender and can be May302025 What Types of Gold Are Eligible for a Gold Loan: An Expert GuideSummary: You can get a gold loan by pledging BIS-hallmarked jewellery or bank-issued gold coins.

Brand Manappuram, the Early Days | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Manappuram Finance Limited, has in recent years, emerged as a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India under the stewardship of Shri V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the Company. Brand Manappuram, the Early DaysHow a local brand became a National BrandTo talk about how Manappuram evolved from a local brand to a national brand is to begin with an exaggeration.For much of its life, Manappuram was not even a local or regional brand in the sense we would understand the term to mean today. In fact, Manappuram began as a village brand, and that was how it stood for many decades. It was strongly identified with the village of Valapad where it was established in 1949, and where it functioned as a single branch business involved in money lending and pawn broking on a modest scale. This was how remained until 1986, when its founder Shri V.C. Padmanabhan (father of Shri V.P. Nandakumar) expired.Remarkably, even as it remained a business with strictly limited reach, it had managed to become a highly successful and greatly trusted brand with deep roots in the local community. Over the decades, Shri Padmanabhan had earned a reputation for integrity and the firm became known in the area as a safe-haven for the deposits of the local people, offering them higher returns along with assured safety. True to the stereotype of a conservative banker, Shri Padmanabhan was averse to risks. He ran his business on a capital base of Rs.5 lakhs and had imposed upon himself a voluntary limit of Rs.25 lakhs being the maximum deposits he would accept from the public. Beyond this limit, potential depositors were either turned away or made to wait for their turn in a queue. As and when an existing depositor withdrew his money, Shri Padmanabhan would send out inland letters to the next in line, informing them of the availability of a slot and grateful depositors would rush in with their money.And such was the formidable reputation of the firm that even as it remained anchored in Valapad, the deposits came in from around the world, from locals who had moved out of the Valapad area to the Gulf countries and to other parts of India in search of employment, and who continued to carry their trust in the Manappuram name with them.When Shri Nandakumar took over the reins in 1986, it was this resolute trust in the Manappuram name—the goodwill that served as a hidden capital of the business—that he was able to leverage. Very early on, he decided to do away with the voluntary limits on deposits and loans and business levels shot up, quickly going over the one crore rupee mark and beyond. However, before long, the limitations of operating under a proprietary concern became clear and Manappuram Finance Limited (MAFIL) was incorporated in 1992. The company went in early for an IPO in 1995 because the experience of trying to raise funds from the Commercial Banks was frustrating—even after mortgaging his personal residence, Banks were unwilling to lend him the amounts he was looking for. But the financial implications of a public issue were daunting. At that time, the rule was that a company going in for the IPO should have a minimum of Rs.3 crores as paid-up capital and MAFIL, at the time, was about half of that. Shri Nandakumar launched an initiative to collect small retail investments from among the Manappuram customers belonging to the Valapad area who were personally known to him. Once again, it was the trust that people of the area had in the Manappuram name that came to his rescue. The funds were mobilized and the issue went through without a hitch.This was how Manappuram Finance Limited (MAFIL) got its start and the rest, as they say, is history.

Manappuram's Pioneering Contributions to Gold Loans | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Manappuram Finance Limited, has in recent years, emerged as a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India under the stewardship of Shri V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the Company. Manappuram's Pioneering Contributions to Gold LoansManappuram’s pioneering contributions to gold loansIn November 2010, Manappuram Finance Ltd. hit the capital market with a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) issue to raise Rs.1,000 crores. The response was enthusiastic and the entire amount was garnered in a matter of hours. Later, in April 2011, the IPO of Muthoot Finance (another Kerala based NBFC dealing predominantly in gold loans) attracted bids reportedly worth more than 24 times the issue size of Rs.900 crores. As with the Manappuram QIP, some of the leading names of international finance were subscribers to the Muthoot IPO as well.There is no doubt that India’s gold loan sector has come of age. More and more people are shedding age-old taboos to borrow money against their gold jewellery making this one of India’s fastest growing businesses of recent years. And yet, even as the sector continues to attract media attention, it is easy to forget that things were not always like this... that even as late as 2007, few at the national level had heard of Manappuram or Muthoot, and fewer in the capital markets cared about gold loans. So, how did the change come about? How did an unglamorous activity carried on for ages suddenly manage to capture the imagination?Without a doubt, this story begins with Manappuram Finance Limited and its entry into the gold loan space in the year 1998.Manappuram Finance Ltd. was incorporated in 1992 (the original name was Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Ltd.) and came to the stock market with its IPO in 1995. The response was just about adequate. The company was focussed on leasing, hire purchase and general finance and the results were not encouraging. Towards the end of 1996, the CRB scam broke out and the NBFC sector in India was face to face with its toughest days ever. RBI came down hard on the sector and funding sources dried up. It was against this background that Manappuram Finance Limited decided to get into gold loans in a big way. In hindsight, the move turned out to be a masterstroke and a game changer.Historically, Manappuram had begun as a gold loan outfit and even after Manappuram Finance Limited was incorporated, gold loans continued in a limited way under the old proprietary concern. Thanks to this legacy, the nitty-gritty of the business was well known to its promoters. But even they would not have anticipated that this unprecedented entry of a corporate body into a traditional activity—so far the preserve of pawnbrokers and moneylenders operating in lanes and by-lanes—would go on shake up the entire sector, and create ripples in the national and international capital markets.Credit Rating As early as 1995, the company acquired the distinction of being the first NBFC from Kerala to go for a credit rating exercise when ICRA assigned a rating of "MA" to its then existing fixed deposit programme (discontinued in March, 2011). Over the years, the ratings have improved steadily and today it enjoys a long term rating of "AA-" from CARE. The short term ratings are, of course, the highest at P1+ from CRISIL and A1+ from ICRA. As the MD & CEO Mr. V.P. Nandakumar notes, "The decision to go for credit rating so early was motivated by a desire to build a culture that values transparency and credibility."First to attract foreign investmentIn December 2007, Manappuram Finance Limited became the first NBFC in Kerala to receive foreign institutional investment when the celebrated PE fund Sequoia Capital invested Rs.70 crores into its equity together with Hudson Equity Holdings. Since then, the company has regularly received foreign investment. The second round of private equity funding in November 2008 was led by Ashmore Alchemy which, together with Sequoia and Hudson, put in another Rs.108 crores. Sizable foreign investment was also received during the two QIPS in 2010 when a total of Rs.1,245 crores was raised. The company’s management readily admits that the advent of PE investors has led to an improvement in the company’s MIS and risk management practices, besides toning up corporate governance standards.Today, credit is due to Manappuram not only for having marked the way but also for having delivered the performance that has whetted the international investors’ appetite for more.Technology and Product innovationIn the matter of technology, Manappuram Finance Limited was one of the earliest to adopt the “core banking” platform. This was no mean achievement considering that unlike the banking sector there were no ready-made software solutions for gold loans. It came about only because the company invested in developing its own proprietary solutions, and today its technology platform is one of its core strengths. The investment in technology has paid off in many ways, for instance, in streamlining procedures to reduce turnaround times in gold loan disbursal and in implementing advanced risk management practices.In the matter of product innovations too, Manappuram Finance Limited has led the way. Gold loans were for long sold as a “one-size-fits-all” product. The company was a pioneer in introducing variety, for instance, by offering progressively higher loan amounts at higher price points. All gold loan customers borrow against gold, but their needs and compulsions can differ. Today, within the broad category of gold loans, Manappuram Finance offers many standardised products.And now, online Gold Loan: Having invested in an extensive network of 3,300 branches across India for delivering gold loans, Manappuram is now preparing itself for a future where brick and mortar branches become less relevant in a digital world. In October 2015, the company became the first player to launch its Online Gold Loan (OGL) where customers with access to an internet enabled device can avail a gold loan anytime, from anywhere in the world. The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to his bank account. Later, when the loan is repaid, the gold will continue to remain with the Manappuram branch for instant sanction of future loans whenever the need arises. The concept will now be extended further with launch of a co-branded debit card that would enable customers without access to bank accounts to withdraw the money from an ATM anywhere.Celebrity Brand AmbassadorsDespite vast amount of gold in private hands in India, the gold loan business is yet to grow to its true potential. There is a continuing stigma attached to pledging gold. And so, rather than use their gold to raise money, many would still prefer go to moneylenders and borrow at exorbitant rates.Manappuram Finance Limited has been proactive in tackling this sensitive issue head-on. It adopted a strategy of a large-budget advertising campaign revolving around high-profile and credible brand ambassadors with a strong regional appeal, who talk to the masses in their own language and educate them about gold loans. The campaign, featuring stars like Mohanlal and Akshay Kumar, has been hugely successful in growing the gold loan category as a whole, and benefits have been reaped by players across the sector.Gold loans and the economyAt anywhere between 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes (World Gold Council’s estimate) India has the world’s largest stock of privately held gold. When gold is held idle in lockers and vaults, it is a drag on the economy that keeps billions of dollars in savings out of the financial system. Today, thanks to the example set by Manappuram, a host of new players were encouraged to get into the business. The commercial banks were also for a time very enthusiastic in promoting gold loans though, after the sharp pull-back in gold prices in 2013, that enthusiasm has waned somewhat. In the meantime, in 2015, the government of India launched its Sovereign Gold Bonds and the Gold Monetisation Scheme with the objective of drawing out gold and make it productive by getting it back into the financial system. In the days ahead, one can reasonably expect more of idle gold to emerge from our lockers and be put to productive use. And that will be owed, in part at least, to that initial lead given by Manappuram Finance. Further, there are efficiency gains that result when people are given access to credit with a minimum of hassle and no time wasted. Gold loans are typically small ticket loans taken for short durations and thanks to Manappuram’s investments in technology and modern management techniques, they are now a source of “instant credit”. To the tens of thousands of ordinary people who depend on their labour for livelihood, this is a blessing. After all, there is an opportunity cost in trying to get hold of loans where the effort in obtaining the same involves sacrificing your wages and earnings for two, three or more days.As the gold loan NBFCs expand their reach, they displace the unorganised sector—neighbourhood pawnbrokers and moneylenders—and effectively push back the frontiers of the parallel economy. This is a service to the economy whose major beneficiary is the government. For instance, in fiscal year 2015-16, Manappuram Finance reported a profit before tax of nearly Rs. 550 crores of which Rs.193 crores was transferred to the government as corporate income tax. A year before, the company had paid Rs.142 crores as income tax out of profit before tax amounting to Rs.414 crores. Had business remained in the hands of the unorganised sector, the government would not get anything.Looking aheadFor all the visibility, this is no time for India’s gold loan NBFCs to rest on their laurels. In relation to the country’s vast stock of privately held gold, the gold loans market remains underpenetrated. Moreover, gold loan customers are still largely drawn from the lower socio-economic classes. The wealthier sections, who also own large quantities of gold, generally stay away. For the economy to derive full benefits from the monetization of gold, it is necessary that the idle gold belonging to the upper strata is also unlocked. This is the new challenge that the gold loan NBFCs are up against. With Manappuram launching Online Gold Loan (OGL), there are welcome signs that gold loans are gaining increasing acceptability among the well-off. The process must now be taken forward.(Updated in July, 2016) ONLINE GOLD LOANWith our new online gold loan facility, you can avail gold loan 24x7, from anywhere in the world!Get StartedServicesOnline Gold Loan Gold Loan Forex and Money Transfer Vehicle Loan Digital Personal Loan SubsidiaryMicro Finance Subsidiary Home Loan Subsidiary Insurance Subsidiary Blog May302025 How to Calculate Your Gold Loan Eligibility Amount: A Step-by-Step GuideSummary: You can calculate your gold loan eligibility by entering your gold's weight, type, and purity into an online gol May302025 What is the Minimum Weight Required for a Gold Loan?Summary: This guide explains the minimum gold weight required to apply for a gold loan, which varies by lender and can be May302025 What Types of Gold Are Eligible for a Gold Loan: An Expert GuideSummary: You can get a gold loan by pledging BIS-hallmarked jewellery or bank-issued gold coins.

Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the Company. Shri V.C. Padmanabhan was born in the year 1916. In 1949, he established Manappuram in the coastal village of Valapad where people mostly depended on fishing for a livelihood. The firm carried out money lending and pawn broking on a modest scale. In his own way, Shri V.C. Padmanabhan was a visionary who started his own simple business to disburse small loans to the needy. Those were days when banks were not as numerous as today and documentation requirements prior to loan disbursal were forbidding. The vision and entrepreneurial spirit in Shri Padmanabhan foresaw the need to cater to this segment that needed money for small purposes and did not have the time or the literacy levels to approach banks. And to this day, the Manappuram story continues to be strongly identified with Valapad, where it functioned for long as a single branch business until his death in 1986. Over the years, Shri Padmanabhan managed the business in a very traditional way, on a tight leash, and never expanding out of Valapad. And yet, it had managed to become a highly successful and greatly trusted name with deep roots in the local community. Shri Padmanabhan earned a reputation for integrity, and Manappuram became known in the Valapad area as a safe-haven for the deposits of the local people, offering higher returns along with assured safety. True to the stereotype of a conservative banker, Shri Padmanabhan was averse to risks. He ran his business on a capital base of Rs.5 lakhs and had imposed upon himself a voluntary limit of Rs.25 lakhs being the maximum deposits he would accept from the public. Beyond this limit, potential depositors were either turned away or made to wait for their turn in a queue. As and when an existing depositor withdrew his money, Shri Padmanabhan would send out inland letters to the next in line, informing them of the availability of a slot, and grateful depositors would rush in with money, to take advantage of the offer. And such was the formidable reputation of the firm that even as it remained anchored in Valapad, the deposits came in from around the world, from locals who had moved out of the Valapad area to the Gulf countries and to other parts of India in search of employment, and who continued to carry their trust in the Manappuram name with them. That was how things remained until 1986, when Shri V.C. Padmanabhan passed away. When his son, Shri V.P. Nandakumar, took over the reins, it was this resolute trust in the Manappuram name—the goodwill that served as the hidden capital of the business—that he was able to leverage. Very early on, he decided to do away with the voluntary limits on deposits and loans and business levels shot up, quickly going over the one crore rupee mark and beyond. However, before long, the limitations of operating under a proprietary concern became clear and he promoted Manappuram Finance Limited in 1992. The company went in early for an IPO in 1995 because the experience of trying to raise funds from the Commercial Banks was to prove frustrating. Even after mortgaging his personal residence, Banks were unwilling to lend him the amounts he was looking for.However, the financial implications of a public issue were daunting. Those days, the rule was that a company going in for the IPO should have a minimum of Rs.3 crores as paid-up capital and Manappuram Finance, at the time, had about half of that. Shri Nandakumar launched an initiative to collect small retail investments from among the Manappuram customers belonging to the Valapad area who were familiar with the legacy of his father. Once again, it was the trust that people of the area had in the Manappuram name that came to his rescue. The funds were mobilized and the issue went through without a hitch. That was how Manappuram Finance Limited got its start and the rest, as they say, is history.These days, every year, in the month of June, Manappuram Finance Ltd. commemorates its founder with the “V.C. Padmanabhan Memorial Annual Lecture and Awards for Excellence” instituted in his name.​V.C.

MD & CEO's Message | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Manappuram Finance Limited, has in recent years, emerged as a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India under the stewardship of Shri V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the Company. A FUTURE WITH GOLD, AND BEYOND GOLDThank you for your interest in our company. As you browse through this website you will discover why Manappuram Finance Limited is a leader in the gold loans business in India and how, with recent diversification into new businesses like microfinance, home and vehicle loans, we are poised for the next phase of growth. There’s no denying that gold loans have a distinct place in the Indian financial sector, with potential and possibilities unlike any other business. It begins with the well known fact that India has the world’s largest stock of privately held gold estimated at between 22,000 to 25,000 tonnes, and amounting to about 10% of the world stock. The gold loans business is about unleashing the hidden power of this gold, bringing to life what is otherwise a dead investment. The market potential for gold loans in India is vast. Less than 10% of our private gold has been monetised. The rest lies idle in safes and vaults in millions of homes across India. Surprisingly, about 65% of the gold in India is held by rural households. That’s why, in a country keen to promote financial inclusion of the rural population, gold loans are now recognized as a powerful tool to achieve this objective.Manappuram Finance Limited stands at the forefront of India’s quest to convert its gold into a socially relevant business opportunity. We are proud to have transformed this age-old activity by introducing scale, transparency and professionalism to this business. A gold loan is among the safest loans products with the lowest delinquencies. At Manappuram, we lend mostly against household used jewellery to which people tend to be emotionally attached and which distinguishes gold loans from any other commodity lending.Over the last two decades, we have been one of the fastest growing companies in India and a leading wealth creator for our investors. In November 2015, I was at the BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) to mark 20 years of Manappuram’s listing at the exchange. At the function, it was noted that shareholder wealth since listing in 1995 had gone up 92 times (not counting the uninterrupted dividends). A year later, in January 2017, Manappuram Finance Limited was ranked at the 13th position in the list of the Top 20 wealth creators in the stock market published by Moneylife magazine. However, in 2012, we hit a rough patch due to certain fundamental changes in the regulations governing gold loans. Financial sector regulators in India expressed serious concerns about the concentration risk inherent in our mono-line business model. Later, we saw for ourselves how the exclusive focus on gold loans made us vulnerable to sharp fluctuations in the price of gold. That was when we initiated bold moves to become a multi product company, by simultaneously diversifying into new business areas like microfinance, home loans, vehicle loans and SME lending.In February 2015, we acquired the Chennai based Asirvad Microfinance Pvt. Ltd. This was a microfinance company with a good management committed to the cause of microfinance and yet struggling against odds to grow. At the time, it had assets under management or AUM a little short of Rs.3,000 million. Today, three year after it became our subsidiary, Asirvad’s AUM has grown to more than Rs.24,000 million. From a presence in just 3 states when we took over, Asirvad is now active in 22 states and Union Territories. India’s microfinance sector is once again doing well and we expect Asirvad Microfinance to continue to sparkle in the coming years too. Our other new businesses — Commercial vehicle loans and housing finance loans —now contribute over Rs. 11,200 million to our total AUM of about Rs. 166,180 million. Importantly, they have all attained a measure of stability and we are confident that we can scale up rapidly from here on.Moreover, having introduced technology to the otherwise hidebound gold loans business, we continue to live up to our motto of “make life easy”. After investing in an extensive network of 3,331 branches across India for delivering gold loans (and another 875 branches for microfinance and housing loan), we are now preparing ourselves for a future where brick and mortar branches will increasingly play a supplementary role in a digitising world. In September 2015, we became the first player to launch Online Gold Loan (OGL). A customer who has completed the initial formalities can now avail a gold loan 24X7, from anywhere in the world, in fact, even as he sits at home. The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to his bank account. Later, when the loan is repaid, the gold will continue to remain with the Manappuram branch for instant sanction of future loans to the customer whenever he or she needs the money.In conclusion, when I look back at our journey of two and a half decades, I can say with pride that Manappuram Finance has played a stellar role in countering prejudice, shaping attitudes, and winning acceptance for gold loans across India. And when I look ahead, I see Manappuram Finance continuing with the good work and setting the pace in its new focus areas, be it microfinance, home and vehicle loans, SME lending, Insurance broking, or in any other new businesses we may get into in future.

Gold Loan FAQ | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Gold Loan FAQHow are Gold Loans different from other loans like Personal Loan or Credit Card?Gold loan is sanctioned by accepting the gold ornaments of the customer as pledge. Personal loan is sanctioned on the basis of source of income and repayment capacity of an applicant. It is true that Gold loans, like personal loans or credit card borrowings, are often used for short term household requirements. However, in terms of the cost and ease of availing the loan, and the convenience when repaying, gold loans are a better bargain. Personal loans and credit card borrowings are unsecured loans and therefore may carry a higher rate of interest. Moreover, personal loans require considerable effort in documentation formalities and they commit you to an inflexible EMI schedule for repayment. Gold loans, on the other hand, are cheaper and can be availed of in minutes. You can also stretch the repayment to your convenience; the only requirement is that you have to service the interest periodically. Credit card borrowings may be easier to avail than even gold loans but the interest rates are prohibitive and it can lure people into a debt-trap.Who is eligible to avail Manappuram Gold loans?

The interest and risk premium is applicable only for the days the money was actually utilised. There are no prepayment penalties.Monthly compounding interest is charged, which the borrower has to pay at the specified periodicity or at the closure of loan, whichever is earlier. The interest rate is fixed and calculated on a reducing balance basis.What is the tenor of such loans?Our gold loan products have a tenor of three months. Customers are counselled to service the interest on a monthly basis, to avoid risk of default.How long will it take for me to get my gold loan?Once you submit your application form and supporting documents, we shall give approval within a matter of minutes provided everything is in order.

The staff will enquire into your account in the (computer) system and inform you of the outstanding loan amount (principal + interest accrued).

Due care is taken during appraisal to ensure that there is no damage to the ornament during any stage of appraising or storing.What are the things that people should keep in mind while taking a gold loan?The most important things from the customer’s perspective are transparency, security and choice of loan product to suit individual requirements. Transparency would help the customer see for himself what he gets in return for what he pays. There should be no hidden costs and no nasty surprises. Security is about how well the gold is physically secured, and also about the internal systems and procedures at the company which ensure that there is no scope for any mala fide actions after the jewellery has been pledged. The choice of loan products should cover the range from high LTV (loan to value) to low LTV, with appropriate variations in interest rates. At Manappuram, you will find that all these aspects are well taken care of.What makes Manappuram Finance different from other providers of gold loans?In addition to the transparency, security and range of its gold loan products (as mentioned above), Manappuram Finance distinguishes itself from others primarily on the basis of the ease with which gold loans can be availed from our branches. The only requirement is that borrowers present themselves at our branches with the gold jewellery and with a valid ID and address proof. Our streamlined systems and procedures ensure that a gold loan can be availed in a matter of minutes. Also, we offer the highest LTV to those interested in availing the maximum amount of loan against their jewellery. We are able to do this because with our long experience in the business, we have acquired the capability to handle the extra risk involved.What are some of the gold loan schemes that Manappuram Finance offers to suit its customers from different income groups?Our gold loan schemes fall broadly into following categories:a) High loan to value: These schemes offer the maximum amount of loan per gram. At the same time, in keeping with the extra risk, the interest cost to the borrower is higher. Typically, such schemes will have a tenure of 3 months.b) Low interest rate: In this category, the interest rates are lower but the Loan to Value (LTV) is also comparatively less.Our products are tailored not to the income group of the customer, but to relevant considerations like how much loan customers would like to avail against a given item of jewellery, and their comfort levels with respect to the interest rate and periodicity of repayment of interest and principal. Incidentally, gold loans can be availed at our branches for amounts as low as a thousand rupees and as high as 1.5 crore rupees & even above 1.5 crore as exception.In case of default, when will the gold jewellery be auctioned off?In case of persisting overdue, the ornaments are liable to be auctioned but only after giving sufficient notice to the borrower. Manappuram serves a reminder to its overdue accounts apart from periodic SMS reminders to our customers to alert them to the overdue in the account. Moreover, we also send auction intimation prior to the auction. We reiterate that (1) periodical monthly payment of interest due and (2) re set your account on or before due date, are recommended as an easy way to avoid such contingencies.Whom do I contact for more details?Kindly get in touch with the staff at the branch nearest to where you are located.

Whistle Blower Policy | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Whistle Blower PolicyPREFACEManappuram Finance Limited believes in the conduct of the affairs of its constituents in a fair and transparent manner by adopting highest standards of professionalism, honesty, integrity and ethical behaviour. Towards this end, Manappuram Finance Limited has formulated the personnel policies that should govern the actions of Manappuram Finance Limited and their employees. Any actual or potential violation of the policy, howsoever insignificant or perceived as such, would be a matter of serious concern for the Company. The role of the employees in pointing out such violations of the policy cannot be undermined.Reporting ConcernsEvery employee of the Company shall promptly report to the management, in the manner provided here in, any actual or possible violation of the employment rules or an event he becomes aware of that could affect the business or reputation of his or the Company.Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement between listed companies and the Stock Exchanges has been recently amended which, inter alia, provides for a non mandatory requirement for all listed companies to establish a mechanism called 'Whistle Blower Policy' for employees to report to the management instances of unethical behaviour, actual or suspected, fraud or violation of the employment rules, working of the Company or ethics policy.Accordingly, this Whistle Blower Policy ("the Policy") has been formulated with a view to provide a mechanism for employees of the Company to approach the Audit Committee of the Company.DEFINITIONSThe definitions of some of the key terms used in this Policy are given below."Audit Committee" means the Audit Committee constituted by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with Section 292A of the Companies Act, 1956 and read with Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement with the Stock Exchanges."Employee" means every employee of the Company including the Directors in the employment of the Company."Investigators" means those persons authorised, appointed, consulted or approached by Audit Committee and include the auditors of the Company and the police."Protected Disclosure" means any communication made in good faith that discloses or demonstrates information that may evidence unethical or improper activity."Subject" means a person against or in relation to whom a Protected Disclosure has been made or evidence gathered during the course of an investigation."Whistle Blower" means an Employee making a Protected Disclosure under this Policy.SCOPEThe Whistle Blower's role is that of a reporting party with reliable information. They are not required or expected to act as investigators or finders of facts, nor would they determine the appropriate corrective or remedial action that may be warranted in a given case.ELIGIBILITYAll Employees of the Company are eligible to make Protected Disclosures under the Policy. The Protected Disclosures may be in relation to matters concerning the Company.DISQUALIFICATIONSWhile it will be ensured that genuine Whistle Blowers are accorded complete protection from any kind of unfair treatment as herein set out, any abuse of this protection will warrant disciplinary action. Protection under this Policy would not mean protection from disciplinary action arising out of false or bogus allegations made by a Whistle Blower knowing it to be false or bogus or with a mala fide intention.Whistle Blowers, who make three or more Protected Disclosures, which have been subsequently found to be mala fide, frivolous, baseless, malicious, or reported otherwise than in good faith, will be disqualified from reporting further Protected Disclosures under this Policy. In respect of such Whistle Blowers, the Company/Audit Committee would reserve its right to take/recommend appropriate disciplinary action.PROCEDURE FOR PROTECTED DISCLOSURESAll Protected Disclosures should be addressed to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Company. The contact details of the Chairman of the Audit Committee are as under:OFFICE ADDRESSRESIDENTIAL ADDRESSThe ChairmanAudit CommitteeManappuram Finance LtdManappuram House,Valapad,Thrissur-680567Mr. P.Manomohanan6th Floor,1061 TOPAZSobha CityPuzhakkalThrissur-6800Protected Disclosures should preferably be reported in writing so as to ensure a clear understanding of the issues raised and should either be typed or written in a legible handwriting in English, Hindi or in the regional language of the place of employment of the Whistle Blower.The Protected Disclosure should be forwarded under a covering letter which shall bear the identity of the Whistle Blower. The Chairman of the Audit Committee shall detach the covering letter and discuss the Protected Disclosure with Members of the Audit Committee and if deemed fit, forward the Protected Disclosure for investigation.Protected Disclosures should be factual and not speculative or in the nature of a conclusion, and should contain as much specific information as possible to allow for proper assessment of the nature and extent of the concern and the urgency of a preliminary investigative procedure. The Whistle Blower must disclose his/her identity in the covering letter forwarding such Protected Disclosure. Anonymous disclosures will not be entertained by the Audit Committee as it would not be possible for it to interview the Whistle Blowers.INVESTIGATIONAll Protected Disclosures reported under this Policy will be thoroughly investigated by the Audit Committee who may at its discretion, consider involving any Investigators for the purpose of investigation. The decision to conduct an investigation taken by the Audit Committee is by itself not an accusation and is to be treated as a neutral fact-finding process. The outcome of the investigation may not support the conclusion of the Whistle Blower that an improper or unethical act was committed.The identity of a Subject will be kept confidential to the extent possible given the legitimate needs of law and the investigation.Subjects will normally be informed of the allegations at the outset of a formal investigation and have opportunities for providing their inputs during the investigation.Subjects shall have a duty to co-operate with the Audit Committee or any of the Investigators during investigation to the extent that such co-operation sought does not merely require them to admit guilt.Subjects have a right to consult with a person or persons of their choice, other than the Investigators and/or members of the Audit Committee and/or the Whistle Blower.Subjects shall be free at any time to engage counsel at their own cost to represent them in the investigation proceedings but have a responsibility not to interfere with the investigation. Evidence shall not be withheld, destroyed or tampered with, and witnesses shall not be influenced, coached, threatened or intimidated by the Subjects. Unless there are compelling reasons not to do so, Subjects will be given the opportunity to respond to material findings contained in an investigation report. No allegation of wrongdoing against a Subject shall be considered as maintainable unless there is good evidence in support of the allegation.Subjects have a right to be informed of the outcome of the investigation. If allegations are not sustained, the Subject should be consulted as to whether public disclosure of the investigation results would be in the best interest of the Subject and the Company.The investigation shall be completed normally within 45 days of the receipt of the Protected Disclosure and in any case not to exceed 90 days . In case it could not be completed within the normal time progress report may be shared to the Audit Committee.PROTECTION TO WHISTLE BLOWERSNo unfair treatment will be meted out to a Whistle Blower by virtue of his/her having reported a Protected Disclosure under this Policy. Manappuram Finance Company Limited , as a policy, condemns any kind of discrimination, harassment, victimization or any other unfair employment practice being adopted against Whistle Blowers. Complete protection will, therefore, be given to Whistle Blowers against any unfair practice like retaliation, threat or intimidation of termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion, or the like including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the Whistle Blower's right to continue to perform his duties/functions including making further Protected Disclosure.The Company will take steps to minimize difficulties, which the Whistle Blower may experience as a result of making the Protected Disclosure. Thus, if the Whistle Blower is required to give evidence in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Company will arrange for the Whistle Blower to receive advice about the procedure, etc.The identity of the Whistle Blower and any other Employee assisting in the said investigation shall be kept confidential to the extent possible and permitted under law. But Whistle Blowers are cautioned that their identity may become known for reasons outside the control of the Audit Committee (e.g. during investigations carried out by Investigators).INVESTIGATORSInvestigators are required to conduct a process towards fact-finding and analysis.Investigators shall derive their authority and access rights from the Audit Committee when acting within the course and scope of their investigation.Technical and other resources may be drawn upon as necessary to augment the investigation.All Investigators shall be independent and unbiased both in fact and as perceived. Investigators have a duty of fairness, objectivity, thoroughness, ethical behavior, and observance of legal and professional standards.Investigations will be launched only after a preliminary review which establishes that the alleged act constitutes an improper or unethical activity or conduct, and either the allegation is supported by information specific enough to be investigated, or matters that do not meet this standard may be worthy of management review, but investigation itself should not be undertaken as an investigation of an improper or unethical activity.DECISIONIf an investigation leads the Audit Committee to conclude that an improper or unethical act has been committed, the Audit Committee shall direct the management of the Company to take such disciplinary or corrective action as the Audit Committee deems fit. It is clarified that any disciplinary or corrective action initiated against the Subject as a result of the findings of an investigation pursuant to this Policy shall adhere to the applicable personnel or staff conduct and disciplinary procedures. The decision of the audit committee shall be final in respect of the disclosure.REPORTINGThe Audit Committee shall submit a report to the management on a regular basis about all Protected Disclosures referred to him/her since the last report together with the results of investigations, if any.RETENTION OF DOCUMENTSAll Protected Disclosures in writing or documented along with the results of investigation relating thereto shall be retained by the Company for a minimum period of seven years.POWER OF AUDIT COMMITTEE TO FRAME PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINESSubject to the provisions of this policy, the Audit Committee may put in place appropriate procedures and guidelines for implementing all or any of the matters covered in the policy.AMENDMENTThe Company reserves its right to amend or modify this Policy in whole or in part, at any time without assigning any reason whatsoever. However, no such amendment or modification will be binding on the employees unless the same is notified to the employees in an appropriate manner. The above shall form part of the present employment and other personnel policies of the Company.

V.P. Nandakumar | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Message fromV.P. Nandakumar"We were able to bear the shocks due to our investments in advanced technologies which allowed us to offer customers the best-in-class products and services, even when our branches were closed by lockdowns"V.P. NandakumarMD & CEODear Shareowners,I am delighted to share with you our 29th Annual Report for the financial year ending March 31, 2021. The trust of our customers and the dedication of our employees helped us achieve profitable growth in an especially turbulent year. Our consolidated AUM grew by 7.92% to ₹ 272.24 billion, and net profit improved by 16.53% to ₹ 17,249.5 million, the highest ever.FY 2021 witnessed a once-in-a-century crisis in form of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdowns that followed disrupted almost every economic activity. Economies around the world went into a tailspin and economic activity contracted sharply. Authorities responded to the crisis with large monetary and fiscal stimulus plans to safeguard lives and livelihoods. Globally, the fiscal stimulus to combat the pandemic has topped trillions of dollars and expansionary monetary policy has supported growth to a large extent. As a result, the world economy is gradually heading towards revival. IMF revised its forecast for the global economy, which is estimated to contract by about 3.5% in 2020, an upgrade from its previous prediction of -4.5% made in June 2020.The lockdowns imposed to combat the spread of the virus had a devastating impact on the Indian economy at a time when it was already facing a slowdown. COVID-19 exacerbated the situation with the economy’s growth rate tipping over into negative territory. Since then, there were signs of a sharp recovery as well, driven by a significant uptick in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Investment demand grew by 2.6% in Q3 FY 2021 after showing lacklustre performance for several quarters. Government spending went up sizably with a focus on capital expenditure to hasten long-term growth. Moreover, many high-frequency indicators show improvement, reinforcing the view that the economy will bounce back.Performance during the yearYour Company was able to withstand the strong headwinds and reported profitability even in the non-gold verticals viz. microfinance, affordable housing, MSME and commercial vehicles segments. We were able to bear the shocks due to our investments in advanced technologies which allowed us to offer customers the best-in-class products and services, even when our branches were closed by lockdowns. Our online gold loan product allowed customers to transact with us and borrow additional amounts even during the lockdown period. Many of our customers were in acute need of funds and we could provide timely service to them with the aid of technology. Our gold loan portfolio showed significant growth during the lockdown phase because, for a while, this was the only credit product readily available to customers as risk aversion spread through the financial sector. Of course, the environment was also supportive as gold prices happened to increase sharply during this time, creating the headroom for borrowers to borrow more.While the momentum in the gold loan business continued, our new business verticals showed their resilience. Nongold verticals now account for 30% of our consolidated AUM and contribute 21% of consolidated net profit. We recorded good growth in consolidated AUM during FY 2021,which, at ₹ 272.24 billion is an increase of 7.92% over the preceding year. Along with the growth in AUM and the highest ever net profit of ₹ 17,249.5 million, we have delivered attractive returns to our investors with ROA of 5.61% and ROE of 26.17%. Our net worth stands at over ₹ 73.07 billion, and our standalone capital adequacy ratio is at a healthy 29.02%. The overall picture conveys growth and profitability, and the confidence that we can further improve our performance in the times to come.Fluctuating gold prices and risk management in gold loansOver the past few months, after the first announcement of a successful vaccine, gold prices have corrected significantly in the expectation that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. From the peak of US$ 2,000 per troy ounce in August 2020, the price has fallen to levels of US$ 1,700. The good news is that our gold loan business has also evolved to become more resilient to such price fluctuations. The change is most apparent in our risk management where the old thinking has given way to new. In 2014, looking at the increasing volatility in gold prices, your company had put in place a well-thoughtout strategy to reduce its exposure to gold price volatility. Learning from previous episodes of gold price volatility, we realised that a short-term gold loan product is the best way to manage the gold price risk. Accordingly, we shifted almost the entire gold loan portfolio to a tenure of 3 months, a departure from the industry practice of granting gold loans for a tenure of 12 months.The short-term product offers benefits both to the customer and to the company. The company can manage the price risk and asset quality prudently, without taking away flexibility from the customer in terms of his credit requirements. The periodic renewal of the loan and the regular servicing of interest by the customer enforces credit discipline and it also lowers the interest burden on the customer. The customer can also renew the loan indefinitely by periodically settling the interest and resetting the principal to the prevailing gold price.Adapting to the new normalEver since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have been engaged in a race against time to become ready for the ‘new normal’. Within a few days of the lockdown announcement, we succeeded in extending work from home facilities to almost all our employees. This became possible only because of the technology initiatives we have been implementing over the last four or five years. We started our green office project by implementing the paperless system of moving files to make the operations of the head office completely paperless. We conduct all our review meetings online through digital platforms with considerable savings in time and travel cost. Your company was the first gold loan NBFC to launch the online gold loan (OGL) application, which is today the most successful application of its kind in the industry. Launched five years ago, adoption was relatively slow but after the pandemic struck, there was a marked pick-up. Along with OGL, we now offer ‘Doorstep gold loans” where the customer need not visit our branch at all. Our executives call on them at their homes and complete all the formalities and disburse the loan on-the-spot. Summing up, if things have changed because of the pandemic, we are changing too.Thank youI am grateful to regulators and policymakers for having fostered a conducive environment, which has allowed us to perform to the best of our potential. I want to thank our senior management team for demonstrating the ability to execute the vision of the management and for displaying resilience under difficult circumstances in recent months. I also want to thank all our employees for their efforts, and our customers for continuing their longstanding relationships. Also, I want to thank our Board members for their unwavering support and guidance during the past year. While we are constantly focused on our customers, employees, and shareholders, we have continued to support our communities all around. The Manappuram Foundation has made a tangible difference to communities across India.I am grateful to all our stakeholders and partners for their resolute faith in the Company over the past three decades. I seek your continued support so that we consistently improve our performance and fulfil our vision to become a preferred multi-product NBFC for our customers.With best wishesV.P. NandakumarMD & CEO

People | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Skilled and passionate workforceFY 2021 began with the rapid spread of COVID-19, which imposed restrictions on conducting classroom trainings. However, at MAFIL, we had developed the capability to convert all the classroom trainings into the e-learning mode. We were thus able to carry on without interruption, by replacing classroom trainings with e-learning classes. The added advantage was that even when employees were working from home, training classes were accessible to them through laptop or mobile, and they could use their time effectively to complete those courses. We had made 492 e-learning courses available during the period, which proved very effective in keeping employees engaged when working from home.We also created modules highlighting the importance of precautions to be taken during the pandemic period, such as proper use of mask, hand sanitizers and precautions to be taken when inside and outside our workplace.We also created modules highlighting the importance of precautions to be taken during the pandemic period, such as proper use of mask, hand sanitizers and precautions to be taken when inside and outside our workplace.Employee higher education was another area of focus during the year.

Digital strength | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Earning customer trust through technology and innovationAt Manappuram Finance , we understood the importance of innovation and the power of the digital from the time we began our operations. And at a time when there were no readymade software solutions for gold loans, we were one of the earliest to adopt the ‘core banking’ platform to link all our branches real time.Right from streamlining procedures and reducing the turnaround time in gold loan disbursal to implementing advanced risk management practices, we use technology across our business operations. Through the use of bots, we have managed to increase the precision of our operations and reduce costs.To continue becoming smarter, efficient and more technology savvy, we have charted a digital strategy that is based on the three pillars of ‘Innovate’, ‘Differentiate’ and ‘Execute’.PillarsOfferingsInnovate (strategic)Innovative projects to penetrate more markets, gain more customers and stay ahead of competitionSMS-based Gold LoanWhatsApp-based OGL mobility platformDigital personal loansDigital scorecardsOGL digital cardsKiosksBusiness Associates (BA) portalValue-added Services (VAS) portalDifferentiate (tactical)Establishment of business differentiators to ensure brand recall and have our own unique selling pointsCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)Mobile Device Management (MDM)Unified Payments Interface (UPI)Aadhaar-Enabled Payment System (AEPS)Robotic Process Automation (RPA)Adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchainGovernance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), Learning Management System (LMS) and Infra Solutions SD-WANUsage of public cloud, Document Management System (DMS) and digital workflowExecute (operate)Consolidation of Group IT infrastructure by moving to private cloud to serve customers betterReplacement of PCs to mobile devices with MDMSetting up of an outsourced information security organisationInvolvement of professional network integratorsImproved SLA-based support for IT servicesDigital transformation journeyIn our journey of digital transformation, we are focusing primarily on four key areas - digitizing operations for scale, mobile interfaces for servicing customers, unified data architecture and analytics for single customer view, and leveraging new technologies for new businesses. We have custom developed an information technology platform in-house that allows us to record relevant customer details, approve them and disburse the loan; and handle internal audit, risk monitoring and management of suitable credit and pledged gold related information.Advantages of our digital capabilityThe share of digital collections in gold loans has increased steadily over time, standing at 54% in FY 2021, compared to 35% in FY 2020The Business Continuity Plans (BCP) initiated much before the nationwide lockdown enabled us to roll out new projects and ensure efficient operational methodsOur digital capability allows us to amplify revenue across business verticalsWe are working towards establishing an automated solution to verifying the purity of the gold assetsWe went largely paperless, with all our information being moved onlineOur technology platforms – A boon during the lockdownWe have set in motion transformative change with the virtualisation of the office environment. We started our green office project by implementing a paperless system of moving files. The focus was on making systems and procedures paperless, and tech initiatives were launched to make the operations at Head office completely paperless. Today, everything is digital, saving hours of manual file movements.We were the first in the country to introduce digital gold loan, our Online Gold Loan (OGL) product. which is today the most successful application of its kind in the industry. Launched five years ago, adoption was relatively slow but after the pandemic struck, there was a marked pick-up. In OGL, the customer can park his gold in our branches and get a drawing power which can be used as an overdraft limit which may be operated from anywhere using a mobile phone. Recently, for the benefit of those customers who face difficulties in reaching our branches, we have introduced a doorstep gold loan service. Our executives call on the customer at his doorstep and the customer gets the gold loan disbursed to him from within the comfort of his home.As a leader in the NBFC space, Manappuram Finance believes strongly in providing adequate training and learning opportunities to our employees. We made the transition from classroom trainings to virtual classes and eLearning courses, thereby saving time and money. We prepared over 400 e-learning courses of over 220 hours duration and now our Learning Management System is the main platform for learning and development at our Company. We are implementing augmented reality (AR) framework in our training programs to create near real, yet fully virtual classroom environment. AR infused training programmes will impart role critical training and get employees ready for future challenges. AR has the potential to revolutionise the learning industry completely. Technological transformation in the learning space is still in infancy and we are clear that Manappuram will lead from the front.

Overview of the Company | Manappuram Finance Limited Skip to main content Manappuram Finance Limited, has in recent years, emerged as a leading non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India under the stewardship of Shri V.P. Nandakumar, MD & CEO of the Company. Overview of the CompanyManappuram Finance Ltd. is one of India’s leading NBFCs. Promoted by Shri. V.P. Nandakumar, the current MD & CEO, its origins go back to 1949 when it was founded in the coastal village of Valapad (Thrissur District) by his late father Mr. V.C. Padmanabhan. The firm was involved in pawn broking and money lending carried out on a modest scale. Shri Nandakumar took over the reins in 1986 after his father expired.Since then, it has been a story of unparalleled growth with many milestones crossed. Incorporated in 1992, Manappuram Finance Ltd. has grown at a rapid pace. Today, it has more than 5,000 (Includes branches of subsidiary companies) branches across 28 states/UTs with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 430 billion and a workforce of more than 50,000.Many AchievementsSoon after it commenced its operations, the company gathered several “firsts” to its credit. The first non-banking financial company (NBFC) in Kerala to receive a Certificate of Registration issued by the RBI, it was also among the earliest to go for an IPO in 1995. In 2007, it became the first Kerala based NBFC to receive investment from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) when the celebrated PE fund, Sequoia Capital, invested Rs 700 million along with Hudson Equity Holdings. Sizeable foreign investment was received during two QIPS in 2010 when a total of Rs 12,450 million was raised. Manappuram Finance Ltd. was the first NBFC in Kerala to obtain the highest short term credit rating of A1+ from ICRA. In 2010, it became the first Kerala-based NBFC to offer ESOPs (Employee Stock Option Plan) to its middle and senior management functionaries.A Record Of InnovationsAs a pioneer and trailblazer, Manappuram Finance Ltd. has always been an innovator par excellence that enabled it to lead the way and stay ahead in the game.Technology innovations: In the matter of technology, Manappuram was one of the earliest to adopt the “core banking” platform. This was no mean achievement considering that unlike the banking sector there were no ready-made software solutions for gold loans. It came about only because the company invested in developing its own proprietary solutions, and today its technology platform is one of its core strengths. The investment in technology has paid off in many ways, for instance, in streamlining procedures to reduce turnaround time in gold loan disbursal and in implementing advanced risk management practices as described below.Critical to the success of a large-scale gold loan business is the ability to weed out spurious and substandard gold at the pledge stage itself. The purity testing that is carried out essentially verifies the purity of the ornament at a particular point or two. It is not designed for 100 percent certainty. Moreover, the gold loans business emphasizes speed and hassle free experience. Therefore, simplicity of procedure is also a must and a balance has to be struck. At Manappuram, advanced risk management practices were put in place that drew upon the promoter’s intimate understanding of the business. It was implemented through the IT platform which generates alerts to management upon any suspicious or abnormal transactions at the branches. For example, the gold loan business focuses on household used jewellery to which borrowers may be expected to have an emotional connect. When a branch accepts multiple numbers of the same ornament for pledge, it is more likely to be a local jeweller or pawnbroker and the system automatically flags the transaction for verification by internal auditors.In keeping with its record of technology-led innovations, the company launched its product “Online Gold Loans” in 2015. A customer who has completed the initial formalities can now avail a gold loan 24X7, from anywhere in the world, in fact, even as he sits at home. The loan proceeds are instantaneously transferred to his bank account. Yet another innovation from Manappuram is the Doorstep Gold Loan which offers gold loan service at the customer's house.Product innovations: Manappuram has led the way in the matter of product innovations too. Gold loans were for long sold as a “one-size-fits-all” product. The company was a pioneer in introducing variety to it, for instance, by offering progressively higher loan amounts at higher price points. It was also the first to come up with “one-day interest” where borrowers have the option to settle a gold loan at their earliest convenience, even within a day, at a time when the norm was to recover a minimum interest of seven days, or even a month.Historically, all gold loans were sanctioned for one year and bullet repayments of both interest and principal was the norm. After the fierce correction in gold prices in 2013, gold loan companies were faced with higher defaults and profitability took a hit. Manappuram Finance Ltd. launched short term gold loans of three and six month tenure.Innovative approach to raising finance: For a non-banking financial company (NBFC), raising funds was a big challenge in the nineties. In the aftermath of the CRB scam of 1997, raising deposits from the public was difficult and banks were not comfortable with lending to NBFCs in general. Moreover, Manappuram’s foray into gold loans was untested as a business model. Growth was slow in the initial days. The picture was to change only after the company hit upon unconventional ways to raise funds.In the first breakthrough, Manappuram became the first gold loan company to raise finance through the securitization and assignment route in a tie-up with ICICI Bank. The arrangement with ICICI Bank continued to work well for a few years and the company was put on the growth path. Buoyed by the success, the company planned a big expansion of the branch network. However, around 2006, ICICI Bank faced some regulatory hurdles regarding securitization and they could no longer fund the company. With ICICI Bank pulling out, the expansion plans were in jeopardy.At this point, the company chanced to get its second break. Temasek, the sovereign investment fund of Singapore, was looking to expand its footprint in the Indian financial market. Mr. Nandakumar happened to be in Singapore to take part in a conference of NBFCs. Having heard Mr. Nandakumar speak about the gold loan business, Temasek expressed interested in financing Manappuram through their India arm Fullerton. Temasek’s debt participation provided the visibility, and paved the way for other international players to follow.In December 2007, Manappuram became the first NBFC in Kerala to attract foreign institutional investment when the celebrated PE fund Sequoia Capital invested Rs 700 million together with Hudson Equity Holdings. Since then, the company has regularly received foreign investment. The second round of private equity funding in November 2008 was led by Ashmore Alchemy which, together with Sequoia and Hudson, put in another Rs 1,080 million. Sizeable foreign investment was received during the two QIPS in 2010 when a total of Rs 12,450 million was raised. Once private equity came in, the company was able to shift gears and grow much faster than before because now even the PSU banks were willing to lend to it. From this point onwards, there was no looking back.Conventionally, companies have sought funds from foreign investors after they have tapped the domestic banks and other financial institutions. In the case of Manappuram, the order was upended. Because the domestic banks were uncomfortable lending to NBFCs, especially one with an untested business model focused on gold loans, the company went out of India and roped in the foreign players first. Once they were persuaded, the domestic players became more confident about lending to the company.Innovative Marketing Campaign with multiple celebrity Brand Ambassadors: Despite the vast amount of gold in private hands in India, the gold loan business is yet to grow to its true potential even today. There was a continuing stigma attached to pledging gold. Rather than use their gold to raise money, many preferred to go to moneylenders and borrow at exorbitant rates.Manappuram has been proactive in tackling this sensitive issue head-on. It followed a strategy of a big-budget advertising campaign that revolved around celebrity brand ambassadors with strong regional appeal, who talked about gold loans to the masses in their own language. When the fashion was to use one celebrity brand ambassador for a nationwide campaign, Manappuram’s campaign beginning in 2010 had a galaxy of super stars like Akshay Kumar, Mohanlal, Mithun Chakravarty, Vikram, Venkatesh etc. and they were used to target different geographies; Mohanlal for Kerala, Akshay Kumar for the Hindi speaking belt, Vikram for Tamil Nadu etc. The campaign was successful in growing the gold loan category as a whole and benefits were reaped by players across the sector.OwnershipManppuram Finance Ltd. is a professionally run company promoted by Shri V.P. Nandakumar who controls approximately 35% of the total equity of the company. A similar share is held by various Indian and foreign private equity funds while the balance is dispersed among the public. The shares of the company are traded on both the BSE and NSE. The company is managed by a Board consisting of ten directors headed by Shri Shailesh Mehhta, Chairman. Shri Mehta is the founder of the Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management at IIT Bombay. Shri V.P. Nandakumar is the MD & CEO of the company. In January 2017, he was ranked by Business Today magazine as one among the Top 40 CEOs from the BSFI sector. He was one of a select few corporate leaders from India to be shortlisted for the CNBC Asia Business Leader Award 2016 held in Jakarta in November 2016. Shri V.P. Nandakumar has also bagged the Hurun India's award for his remarkable achievements in the world of business and received The Hurun Industry Achievement Award 2022 from top Hurun India officials at a function held in Mumbai on 2nd February 2023. In 2024, Manppuram Finance was adjudged 'Best Mid-size NBFC' at the Mint BFSI Summit and Awards.CSR RedefinedBesides focus on the business, the cause of the wider community is central to the vision of the company. The Manappuram Foundation was established in October 2009 to drive the company’s initiatives in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The major project of the Foundation is an original scheme, “Janaraksha Manappuram Free Health Insurance Scheme” extending health insurance to 20,000 Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in the seven Panchayats located around the Valapad Head Office of the Company. They are now eligible for free medical care up to Rs 60,000 per year along with cashless treatment at some of the leading hospitals in Thrissur District.The Manappuram Foundation has set up the Manappuram Academy for Professional Education to impart free coaching for Professional Courses like CA/CS/ICWA, to bright students from low-income households. The company was honoured with a 'Special Commendation' at the Golden Peacock Awards for Corporate Social Responsibility for the year 2014. In 2024, Manappuram Foundation bagged the 'Best Social Impact Campaign (CSR)' award at the ET Entrepreneur Awards 2024.Recent DiversificationsAs a company focused on gold loans, Manappuram was prone to the concentration risk. Financial sector regulators in India have been expressing concern over the concentration risk inherent in the mono-line business model. To assuage their concerns, the company initiated bold moves to become a multi-product company.Over the last seven years, the company has diversified into new business areas like microfinance, vehicle and housing finance, and SME lending. In February 2015, the company acquired Asirvad Microfinance Pvt. Ltd. with AUM a little short of Rs. 3,000 million. Today, nine years of its takeover, AUM of Asirvad has reached Rs 118.80 billion while the consolidated AUM of Manappuram Finance stands at Rs 420.69 billion. Accelerated growth is beinbg reported in the other new business segments too and non-gold businesses contributed 49 percent of the total business as of March 31, 2024. Rs.
